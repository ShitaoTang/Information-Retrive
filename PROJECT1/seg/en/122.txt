 network working group a mckenzie rfc bbn nic march categories b proposed change in imp to host protocol we are currently considering a redefinition of the imp to host error message types type and type and the creation of addi tional imp to host error message types we believe that these changes will assist the hosts in determining appropriate recovery action without causing any serious reprogramming problems our current plans are to install these changes within a few months therefore we should be informed of any strong negative reactions relatively quickly the proposed changes fall into two general classes as de scribed below a general error message under certain circumstances particularly when the host has been unresponsive to queued input for a long time the imp drops its ready line for a short period causing the error flip flops to be set see rfc nic under these conditions the imp sends a few nop s to the host and then resumes normal operation we propose to send the host a new message message type in addition to the nops this message will tell the host that the imp s ready line was dropped that the imp s error flop was set and that the imp will respond to the next com pletion of a host to imp message with a type or type message because of the setting of the imp s error flop b error messages which are responses to specific host to imp transmissions imp to host message type will be redefined to mean imp s error flip flop was set on a message which the imp cannot identify imp to host message type will be redefined to mean imp s error flip flop was set during receipt of the message identified by the source and link number bits of this error message page imp to host message type will be defined to mean a host to imp message was too short and cannot be identified imp to host message type will be defined to mean a host to imp message was too long the message is identified by the source and link number bits of this error message imp to host message type will be defined to mean a host to imp message with an illegal message type code was received the message is identified by the source and link number bits of this error message note that the erroneous type code is not included in the error message aam jm this rfc was put into machine readable form for entry into the online rfc archives by bbn corp under the direction of alex mckenzie page
