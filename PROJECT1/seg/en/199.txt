 network working group v cerf request for comments ucla nmc obsoletes august nic network measurement note ncp statistics after a lapse of months since rfc was issued march i am pleased to announce that ucla nmc is prepared to gather your ncp statistics automatically on a daily basis the results will be published monthly as network measurement notes and as rfc s we will periodically open a connection on your local socket decimal expecting you to send the following data in the format shown a total bits sent to host b total bits received from host c total messages sent to host d total messages received from host and optionally e average round trip delay on send connections to host the information above should be collected only for standard open connections i e those using standard ncp protocol and not measurement links or experimental ncp links and in particular not traffic on link another optional measurement would be to gather the distribution of message types over link over all hosts i e not broken down by host this will reveal the relative utilization of control messages alloc should be very prevalent the data collected for the last hour sample period should be available from a process listening on local socket number cerf page rfc ncp statistics august word day time on leap year time in minutes at which sample was started ranges from midnight to word source byte n format host size number of host network host related entries number in message c r b m number of bits per byte in byte statistics message statistics byte control statistics message distribution average round trip time cerf page rfc ncp statistics august the remaining words of the message depend on format byte setting foreign host always present messages received if format bit m set bytes received if format bit b set n of these message sent if format bit m set entries bytes sent if format bit b set average delay if format bit r set this is average rfnm delay in milliseconds type count if format bit c set these are link control message distributions for the sample period cumulative overall hosts if a type is not present its count is assumed to be type count cerf page rfc ncp statistics august thus the data you send will look roughly like this word day time word control word data for destination data for destination data for destination n control message distribution word n on completion of transmission of the last message and after you receive the rfnm for this last message close the connection in the original specification we said that the data gathering program would icp to some well known socket we believe this to be an unnecessary complication and instead we will merely open a connection on your decimal expecting you to send data as soon as our allocate command is received by your ncp please let me know if this cannot be done i e you need the icp if you connect to ucla nmc socket we will send you our own hour data anyone interested in capturing these statistics is welcome to do so cerf page rfc ncp statistics august please note that these summarized statistics are for standard local hour period e g local midnight to local midnight they are not for a sliding hour period ending with the time at which statistics were requested also the data is to be collected only for open connections on links the following are participating others are heartily invited ucla nmc dmcg ll this rfc was put into machine readable form for entry into the online rfc archives by helene morin via genie cerf page
