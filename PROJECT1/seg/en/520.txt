time fill and media fill soh start of heading a communication control character used at the beginning of a sequence of characters which constitute a machine sensible address or routing information such a sequence is referred to as the heading an stx character has the effect of terminating a heading stx start of text a communication control character which precedes a sequence of characters that is to be treated as an entity and entirely transmitted through to the ultimate destination such a sequence is referred to as text stx may be used to terminate a sequence of characters started by soh etx end of text a communication control character used to terminate a sequence of characters started with stx and transmitted as an entity eot end of transmission a communication control character used to indicate the conclusion of a transmission which may have contained one or more texts and any associated headings enq enquiry a communication control character used in data communication

standard code table dle data link escape a communication control character which will change the meaning of a limited number of contiguously following characters it is used exclusively to provide supplementary controls in data communication networks dc dc dc dc device controls characters for the control of ancillary devices associated with data processing or telecommunication systems more especially switching devices on or off if a single stop control is required to interrupt or turn off ancillary devices dc is the preferred assignment nak negative acknowledge a communication control character transmitted by a receiver as a negative response to the sender syn synchronous idle a communication control character used by a synchronous transmission system in the absence of any other character to provide a signal from which synchronism may be achieved or retained etb end of transmission block a communication control character used to indicate the end of a block of data for communication purposes etb is used for blocking data where the block structure is not necessarily related to the processing format can cancel a control character used to indicate that the data with which it is sent is in error or is to be disregarded em end of medium a control character associated with the sent data which may be used to identify the physical end of the medium or the end of the used or wanted portion of information recorded on a medium cert page rfc ascii format for network interchange october the position of this character does not necessarily correspond to the physical end of the medium sub substitute a character that may be substituted for a character which is determined to be invalid or in error esc escape a control character intended to provide code extension supplementary characters in general information interchange the escape character itself is a prefix affecting the interpretation of a limited number of contiguously following characters fs file separator gs group separator rs record separator and us unit separator these information separators may be used within data in optional fashion except that their hierarchical relationship shall be fs is the most inclusive then gs then rs and us is least inclusive the content and length of a file group record or unit are not specified del delete this character is used primarily to erase or obliterate erroneous or unwanted characters in perforated tape in the strict sense del is not a control character graphic characters sp space a normally non printing graphic character used to separate words it is also a format effector which controls the movement of the printing position one printing position forward applicable also to display devices general considerations this standard does not define the means by which the coded set is to be recorded in any physical medium nor does it include any redundancy or define techniques for error control further this standard does not define data communication character structure data communication formats code extension techniques or graphic representation of control characters deviations from the standard may create serious difficulties in information interchange and should be used only with full cognizance of the parties involved the relative sequence of any two characters when used as a basis for collation is defined by their binary values cert page rfc ascii format for network interchange october no specific meaning is prescribed for any of the graphics in the code table except that which is understood by the users furthermore this standard does not specify a type style for the printing or display of the various graphic characters in specific applications it may be desirable to employ distinctive styling of individual graphics to facilitate their use for specific purposes as for example to stylize the graphics in code positions and into those frequently associated with logical or and logical not respectively the
