 network working group a mckenzie request for comments bolt beranek and newman nic august categories b l c updates none obsoletes none address tables attached is a copy of a revision to appendix a of bbn report no the revised version of the appendix is our first attempt to make the list of sites attached to the arpa network prospective rather than retrospective we are adopting this approach because of the large number of sites scheduled for attachment in the near future and because many hosts apparently require a site s address to be in some local table before their ncps will permit communication with the site therefore we urge such hosts to add the new sites to their lists of addresses as soon as possible also please note the address change which will be made at bbn on exactly september first incidentally it seems to us that it is irrational for an ncp to discard otherwise valid messages simply because the sender s address doesn t appear in a local table similarly it seems almost as irrational for an ncp to prevent a local user from trying to communicate with a remote site the address of which is known to the user but not stored in the ncp s tables mckenzie page rfc address tables august report no bolt beranek and newman inc appendix a imp and host site identification bit of the leader of most host to imp or imp to host messages define a network address related to the message these bits are not meaningful for message types and in a host to imp message the network address identifies a particular host to which the message should be delivered in an imp to host message the network address identifies the host from which the message originated a network address consists of six bits bits of the leader which specify an imp number preceded by two bits bits of the leader which specify the host number of a particular host connected to that imp the table below gives the decimal values of imp number host number and network address for each host currently connected to the arpa network or scheduled for connection in the near future scheduled installation dates are also shown for hosts not currently connected these dates however are subject to change without notice imp site host network scheduled number name number host address installation ucla sigma ibm sri pdp nic pdp al ucsb ibm utah pdp lo bbn ddp see note pdp a pdp o b note prior to september the bbn pdp o a will be host number network address and the bbn ddp will be host number network address the address change is to be made during the day on mckenzie page rfc address tables august imp site host network schedule number name number host address installation mit honeywell pdp rand o pdp o sdc o ibm harvard o pdp o pdp pdp lincoln o ibm tx stanford o pdp o illinois o pdp case o pdp o carnegie o pdp o paoli o b nasa ames o ibm tip mitre tip radc o h tip nbs o pdp etac tip tinker o iii mcclellan o iii usc ibm tip gwc tip ncar o cdc tip bbn tip tip mckenzie page
