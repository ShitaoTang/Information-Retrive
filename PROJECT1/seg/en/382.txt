 network working group bill duvall request for comments sri unknown title page missing links a control links a logical link will be a control link between any two hosts on the network a a only one control link may exist between any two hosts on the network thus if there are n hosts on the network there are n control links from each host a it will be primarily used for communication between hosts for the purposes of a a establishing user links a b breaking user links a c passing interrupts regarding the status of links and or programs using the links a d monitor communication a imps in the network may automatically trace all messages sent on link b primary links b a user at a given host may have exactly primary link to each of the other hosts on the network b a the primary link must be the first link established between a host user and another host b b primary links are global to a user i e a user program may open a primary link and that link remains open until it is specifically closed duvall page rfc b c the primary link is treated like a teletype connected over a normal data phone or direct line by the remote host i e the remote host considers a primary link to be a normal teletype user b d the primary link is used for passing user control information to the remote host e g it will be used for logging in to the remote host using the remote hosts standard login procedure c auxilliary links c a user program may establish any number of auxilliary links between itself and a user program in a connected host c a these links may be used for either binary or character transmission c b auxilliary links are local to the sub system which establishes them and therefore are closed when that subsystem is left manipulation of links a control links a the control link is established at system load time a the status of a control link may be active or inactive a a the status of the control link should reflect the relationship between the hosts b primary links b primary links are established by a user or executive call to the monitor b a the network identification number of the host to be linked to must be included in the call b b an attempt to establish more than one primary link to a particular host will be regarded as an error and the request will be defaulted b c standard transmission character set duvall page rfc b c there will be a standard character set for transmission of data over the primary links and control links b c a this will be full bit ascii b d get link the protocol for establishing a link to host b from host a is as follows b d a selects a currently unused link to host b from its allocation tables b d a transmits a link connect message to b over link b d a then waits for b d a a communication regarding that link from b b d b a certain amount of time to elaspse b d if a communication regarding the link is received from b it is examined to see if it is b d a a verification of the link from b b d a this results in a successful return from the monitor to the requestor the link number is returned to the requestor and the link is established b d b a request from b to establish the link this means that b is trying to establish the same link as a independently of a b d b if the network id number of a na is greater than that of b nb then a ignores the request and continues to await confirmation of the link from b b d b if on the other hand na nb then host a proceeds to establish a link to host b in the manner outlined above getlink duvall page rfc c d if na result b a this process is known as folding duvall page rfc b a several fields may be added and folded in parallel if they are folded appropiately after the addition field field field field field field field field add v carry add carry add result duvall page rfc b a a using this scheme it is assumed that if there are n fields the carries from the first n fields are automatically added into the low order position of the next higher field so that in folding one need only add the n result fields to the carry from the nth field and then add in an appropiately sized carry from that addition and repeat the desired number of times to achieve the result b a a checksum computed in this manner has the advantage that the word lengths of different machines may each be used optimally b a a if a string of suitable length is chosen for computing the checksum and a suitable checksum field length is selected the checksum technique for each of the machines will be relatively optimal b a a field length bits lowest common denomenator of b a a checksum length bits convenient field size for all machines b b if a message is divided into groups of fields and each group is checksummed in this manner an order dependent checksum may be got by shifting the checksum for each group and adding it in successively to the checksum of the next group c a facility will be provided where two hosts may enter a mode which requires positive verification of all messages this verification is sent over the control link monitor functions a network i o drivers a input a a input message from imp a b do error checking on message a b verify checksum a b send message recieved aknowledgement over control link if aknowledge mode is in effect duvall page rfc a c trans character translation a c there is a strong possibility that the character translation may be done in the imp a c this needs to be explored further with bbn a c there are two main considerations a c a should the translation be done by table or algorithm a c a initially it seems as though the best way to go is table a c b how should we decide which messages should be translated i e is it desirable to not translate everything yes and by what means can we use to differentiate a d decode header and pass message to correct recipient as identified by source and link a output a a build header a b character translation a b see remarks under the section on output translation trans a c create checksum a d check status of link a d if there has not been a rfnm since the last message transmitted out the link wait for it a e transmit message to imp a f if aknowledge mode is in effect wait for a f rfnm from destination imp a f response from destination host over control line duvall page rfc b network status b maintain status of other hosts on network b a if an imp is down then his host is considered to be down b maintain status of control lines b answer status queries from other hosts b inform other hosts as to status of primary and auxilliary links on an interrupt basis b inform other hosts as to status of programs using primary and secondary links executive primitives a primary links a these require the host number as a parameter a a establish primary link a b connect controlling teletype to primary link a c input output over primary link a d interrogate status of primary link a d don t know what exactly this should do but it seems as though it might be useful a e disconnect controlling teletype from primary link a f kill primary link b auxilliary links b establish auxilliary link b a requires the host number as a parameter b b it returns a logical link number which is similar to a file index it is this number which is passed to all of the other auxilliary routines as a parameter b input output over auxilliary link duvall page rfc b interrogate status auxilliary link b a don t know what exactly this should do but it seems as though it might be useful b kill auxilliary link c special executive functions c transparent input output over link c a this may be used to do block i o transfers over a link c b the function of the monitor in this instance is to transfer a buffer directly to its imp c c at does not modify it in any way c c this means that the header and other control information must be in the buffer c d the indended use of this is for network debugging initial checkout a the network will be initially checked out using the links in a simulated data phone mode a all messages will be one character in length a links will be transparent to the monitor and controlled by user program via a special executive primitive a a the initial test will be run from two user programs in different hosts e g ddt to ddt a b it will be paralleled by a telephone link or similar this rfc was put into machine readable form for entry into the online rfc archives by
