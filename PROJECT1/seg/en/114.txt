 network working group e harslem request for comment rand nic february references using network remote job entry overview as has been mentioned in previous rfcs and at previous network meetings various groups at rand have been doing rje to remote network sites ucbs and ucla for over a year until recently all this work has been done from our ibm which is only a network using host not a server recently our pdp has come onto the network as both a user and server host we now have as well a program on the pdp allowing access to the remote job service rjs at ucla our normal mode of operation is diagramed below rand ucla pdp file rjs system access network rjs program user to use rjs the user creates a job source deck in the rand file system he then instructs the rjs access program rjsap to send that file job to rjs sample session below he can then monitor the status of his job via rjsap and hence rjs and ask that rjsap retrieve his print output to a local file or directly to his console the line printer or whatever recently several people at other network sites have expressed an interest in using rjs however they are located at a minimal host or at a host not providing rjs access since the rand pdp is a network server these people can solve their access problem by logging onto the rand pdp using telnet and running the rjsap themselves the remainder of this rfc describe the steps necessary harslem page rfc using network remote job entry february to run that program the rand pdp the rand pdp operates under the tenex operating system thus some understanding of the tenex executive is required the necessary documents can be obtained from the developers of tenex bolt beranek and newman inc moulton street cambridge massachusetts secondly it is necessary to establish an account on the rand pdp this can be done through rod fredrickson the rand corporation main street santa monica california ucla remote job service to use the ucla ibm via rjs it is necessary to have an account at ucla have an assigned rjs terminal id these can both be obtained from bob braden ucla math sciences building boelter hall los angeles calif the rjs access program rjsap a sample session using rjsap is attached below the rjsap is started by typing rjs to the tenex executive the program will then initialize and check via your login information to see if you are a user recorded in its tables this is done to assure you have a valid rjs terminal id if your id is not found the program will terminate with appropriate message harslem page rfc using network remote job entry february if your id is found rjsap will attempt to connect to rjs if ucla is down a message to that effect will appear and the program will terminate if ucla is up rjsap will connect you to rjs and sign on your terminal id see rfc rjsap will respond you are connected to rjs at this point rjs will acknowledge your signon and print out messages regarding system status the programs rjsap and rjs are now ready to perform rje functions all commands are initially interpreted by rjsap they are listed and explained below help if the user types rjsap will echo the and list the valid set of commands see below message to rjs if the first character of a command is a all subsequent characters up to a return are transmitted to rjs on the operator input connection see rfc for the syntax and semantics of these commands an operator input message can be cancelled with the rub out key or backspaced using backspace send a job when the user types s rjsap echoes send source deck from file the user then enters the file name containing his job followed by a return obviously the file must already exist if the file is ok and is transmitted successfully both rjsap and rjs will print an acknowledgement on the user s terminal see example below retrieve job output printer the user can retrieve printed output by entering pr rjsap will echo print output to file the user then enters the files name where he wants the output this can be a new file or even a device such as the printer or teletype when the print output is completely received the rjsap will print an acknowledgment see example harslem page rfc using network remote job entry february retrieve job output punch this function is currently not implemented pending a decision on the use of this channel between a pdp and a transmission status for long transmissions of job input or output it may be desirable to check on the progress of the transmission typing r will cause rjsap to echo report on transmissions followed by a record count for the job input and printer output channels termination if the user types a q at the start of a command rjsap will echo quit in progress and terminate this is the preferred way of terminating the program rather than just c note since rjsap has not been extensively used we expect it to be improved and modified in the future thus the last section of this rfc the explanation of the use of rjsap will be kept in file rjsaccessprogram explanation on the rand pdp and be updated appropriately sample session the follows is a sample session using rjs from rjsap on the rand pdp all user inputs have been underlined
