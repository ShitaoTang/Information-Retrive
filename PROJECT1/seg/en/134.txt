 network working group r t braden request for comments ucla ccn nic july categories obsoletes updates comments on proposed remote job entry protocol chuck holland s draft proposal rfc is an excellent document very complete and consistent since the final standard rje protocol will be widely used on the network honing its definition now will save trouble and discontent later therefore i will proceed to make a new suggestions and pick a few nits in my humble opinion the command verb bye is overly cute i would find quit much less offensive the pathname syntax p may need some reworking it would be very desirable for all protocols or network access programs to use the same syntax for selecting a host and socket and or file name note that the ftp documents use the term pathname in the more restricted sense of a local file system name a the port construction seems very undesirable since it depends upon a particular bit convention of tip s tip s have bent network protocols rather badly in the past but surely we don t want to build their particular socket system into an official protocol b for convenience it may be desirable to allow hex and octal socket numbers c there will probably be other hosts besides tip s which will use the host socket pathname and some of them may want a transmission attribute other than t the proposed syntax should be changed to allow attributes in host socket d i see no reason to exclude attribute te since the control characters cr lf and ff exist in ebcdic as well as ascii e there are many ebcdic codes and at least ascii s the code construction needs expansion page the syntax of out might reflect the fact that pathname is required only for disp of s it may be desirable to distinguish syntactically job id and job file id for example this would allow the command abort job file id to abort the job currently being transmitted regardless of its id this assumes that multiple jobs for a given user are sent sequentially the replies presented in the document are very good but may need some elaboration for example the syntax error messages should be more specific when the user enters out h ucla ne arp wgw test he would like the error message to indicate explicitly that the hostname is not valid rather than merely being told there is something wrong with one of the parameters experience with remote job entry to ccn via the network has shown that the user wants a transmission status command to find out how many records have been sent or received so far the network bandwidth corresponds in order of magnitude to one page per second the average output for jobs submitted to ccn from the network has contained about pages so significant transmission delays are not unusual it is important to add a command for this purpose this rfc was put into machine readable form for entry into the online rfc archives by bbn corp under the direction of alex mckenzie page
