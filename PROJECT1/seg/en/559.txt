 network working group r t braden request for comments ucla ccn nic may ebcdic ascii mapping for network rje a introduction under netrjs ccn s network rje protocol a virtual remote batch terminal may be either ebcdic or ascii ccn operates an ibm which performs all of its normal processing in ebcdic when a virtual ascii terminal signs onto netrjs ccn translates the card reader stream to ebcdic and translates the printer stream back to ascii in recent months a number of ascii hosts rand pdp utah pdp illinois pdp have completed user processes for netrjs several users at these sites have noted deficiencies in the ascii ebcdic mapping rules originally implemented in netrjs since their objections were well founded we have altered the existing mapping and added a new one this rfc has three purposes to make all users of netrjs aware of the changed ascii mapping to call this problem to the attention of the network rje protocol committee to knowledge and support joel winett s pioneering work in this area the ebcdic chimera a year ago joel winett published rfc containing the results of his careful research into just what ebcdic really means he sounded a clarion call for all ebcdic sites to join in defining a network standards mapping at this time we at ccn were primarily absorbed in the timely implementation of the netrjs protocol to serve an ebcdic user site rand so we were not very supportive of his efforts rfc is a valuable document we hope a copy falls into the hands of armonk it is clear from rfc that ebcdic consists of a standard basic set of characters combined with a number of overlapping ad hoc character happenings fortunately if we exclude braden page rfc ebcdic ascii mapping for network rje may special purpose text composition programs ibm programs use only the basic ebcdic graphics shown in rfc as well as in figure an ibm ebcdic keypunch can create graphics the basic ebcdic graphics less the lower case letters in fact os requires an even smaller subset of ebcdic characters commonly called the pl character set the pl set consists of the basic graphics less the lower case letters as well as the three graphics cent sign exclamation point and quotation c character mapping in netrjs we consider now the requirements of a ascii ebcdic mapping for netrjs or any rje protocol these requirements are as follows efficiency the translation should be character to character so that the cpu operation translate can be used and character scans obviated this is important because a significant volume of character data may be moved during rje operations usability all of the ebcdic graphics should be mapped into corresponding ascii characters the mapping should be as nearly transparent as possible i e whenever the same graphic appears in both sets it should map onto itself to minimize the adaptation required of an ebcdic oriented programmer the ascii graphics should evoke the corresponding ebcdic graphic when they are not identical theses considerations led us to incorporate winett s rules ii a and iii b see page of the rfc into netrjs ascii ebcdic braden page rfc ebcdic ascii mapping for network rje may this defines all basic ebcdic graphics in terms of ascii however there is still a question of how to map the maverick ascii characters which are not in ebcdic and not in the list above we could and did take the view that all ccn users are concerned only with writing and executing normal programs using ebcdic and that they would enter one of the maverick ascii graphics only in error our original choice therefore was to map the mavericks in the input into ebcdic question marks we also assumed that if a user needs to access a larger subset of ebcdic than the basic he should do so by doing his rje directly in ebcdic we now realize that there were two deficiencies in the original mapping rules the program may be intended to manipulate ascii text from the network in that case the network user needs to have all ascii characters including the mavericks uniquely mapped into ebcdic in some standard manner the present mapping is convenient only if a user at an at t model teletype or simulator thereof needs a different mapping for ease of use for the first case we have changed the mapping of the maverick ascii characters from using instead winett s rules iii c and iii d ascii ebcdic x ad x bd x b x b x x for the user with a model teletype we have expanded the set of virtual remote batch terminal types adding tty to ascii and ebcdic a user establishes his virtual remote batch terminal as type tty by either doing his initial icp to socket vs for ebcdic for ascii or by doing an icp to socket and entering the command ttyrjs vs rjs for ebcdic arjs for ascii the mapping used by netrjs for a tty remote is braden page rfc ebcdic ascii mapping for network rje may model corresponding graphic ascii ebcdic x bd this is ugly but it is probably the best we can do d conclusions it is obvious that one pair of translation tables won t do the job netrjs needs at least two mappings for each direction how long will it be before an important set of users appears with a different terminal character set requiring yet a different mapping an rje server site needs to be prepared to provide a variety of translation tables and perhaps to allow a user to specify his own table s this mini subset of date reconfiguration service might be necessary to prevent translation table proliferation the tendency in network discussions has been to put the burden upon the user sites to adapt to different conventions in the real world of users and servers the server will often have to do the adapting notes and references r t braden interim netrjs specifications rfc nic july please note that rjs is the proper name of a particular rje package written at ccn the generic name for remote batch service is rje notice that the mapping question discussed in this rfc is significant only for the virtual card reader and printer connections in netrjs the punch connection is always transparent i e never translated the remote operator connections use the extended ebcdic ascii mapping including the maverick characters but this is not important since operator commands require only a limited character set joel winett the ebcdic codes and their mapping to ascii rfc nic july braden page rfc ebcdic ascii mapping for network rje may winett lists only basic ebcdic graphics excluding the space which he regards as a control character this is a matter of taste but we find it less confusing to include the space as a graphic ccn recently received a new teletype replacement terminal this machine has a bastardized graphic character set mostly ascii with a sprinkling of both ebcdic and tty full ascii a b z at t twx mod tty basic ebcdic a b z pl set basic ebcdic figure character sets commonly abused this rfc is also available in ps and pdf format this rfc was put into machine readable form for entry into
