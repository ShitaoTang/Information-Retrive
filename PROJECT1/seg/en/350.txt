 network working group s crocker request for comments ucla nic april categories d obsoletes rfcs updates rfcs a proferred official icp by initial connection protocol icp i mean a third level protocol which is initiated by a user process at one site in order to contact a server process at another site typically the user process will be a telnet and the server process will be a logger but there may be other cases in this rfc i wish to describe a family of icps suitable for establishing one pair of connections one in each direction between any user process and any server process and to propose further a particular subset of this family as the standard icp for connecting user processes to loggers on systems which accept teletype like devices notation we have no standard notation for describing system calls which initiate and close connections or cause data to be sent so i will use the following ad hoc notation init local l foreign f size s causes the local host to attempt to establish a connection between socket l at the local host and socket f with a byte size of s for the connection l is a bit local socket number f is a bit foreign socket number the high order eight bits of which specify the foreign host and s is an eight bit non zero byte size the sum of l and f must be odd listen local l size s causes the local host to wait for a request for connection to local socket l with byte size s the process will be woken when a connection is established the parameters l and s are the same as for init page send socket l data d the data named by d is sent over the connection attached to local socket l l must be a send socket attached to a connection d is the name of a data area receive socket l data d the receive side counterpart to send close socket l any connection currently attached to a local socket l is closed a family of icps briefly a server process at a site attaches a well advertised send socket l and listens a user process initiates connection to l from its receive socket u the byte size for this connection is the server process then transmits a bit even number s and closes the connection the bit number s and its successor s are the socket number the server will use the final steps are for sockets s and s at the server site to be connected to sockets u and u respectively at the user site using the notation the server executes the following sequence listen socket l size wait until a user connects send socket l data s close socket l init local s foreign u size bu init local s foreign u size bs the user executes the following init local u foreign l size receive socket u data s close socket u init local u foreign s size bu init local u foreign s size bs note that l is a send socket odd while s and u are receive sockets even where l s or u are used as values of local they are bit numbers where they are values of foreign they are bit numbers the parameters bs and bu are the byte sizes to be sent by the server and user respectively page examination of the above sequences reveals that an icp is characterized by the three numbers l bs and bu and must meet the restrictions that a l is a send socket b bs and bu are legal byte sizes and c for each l there is only on pair of associated byte sizes this last restriction prevents two distinct services from being available through the same socket and distinguished only by the byte sizes telnet icp for connecting teletype like users i e interactive and ascii to hosts serving such users i propose an icp of the form described above and characterized by l bs bu there has been some confusion about socket numbers here i specifically mean l x formalities i propose that the telnet icp be made official comments should be published before the may nwg meeting the subject will be discussed there and we will decide there to accept or reject this protocol this rfc was put into machine readable form for entry into the online rfc archives by jeff sorte page
