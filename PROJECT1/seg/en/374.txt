 network working group j mcquillan request for comments d walden nic bolt beranek and newman inc july three aids to improved network operation scheduled software maintenance as the arpa network has grown larger we have found it difficult to find times when necessary new software can be slipped into the network without disrupting anyone for instance there is always intrasite traffic between the machines at mit and there is almost always traffic between the ames tip and imp the sun never sets on the arpa network to minimize unscheduled disruptions and to simultaneously let us do what we have to do we propose to schedule a m a m eastern time every tuesday as a time when the imps can be reloaded we will probably not use this period every tuesday but we do reserve this period every tuesday the above period is in addition to the several hours a month already scheduled at each site for hardware preventative maintenance because a network user may not know when his machine is scheduled for maintenance or because he may forget and work through the tuesday morning software period we propose to generalize the imp going down imp to host control message so it may be used to remind the user this message described in detail below will contain information that the imp is going down in m times five minutes for n times minutes for a given reason hosts and the tip should use this information to remind all their network users that the imp will be going down after the stated interval occasionally there is an emergency reason for restarting or reloading an imp for instance while three hosts at a site are functioning well one host cannot communicate with the imp this sort of situation sometimes requires the imp to be restarted such a restart will be preceded by several minutes by an imp going down message to allow working users to save their work in such a way that they can restart once the imp is back up in both of these cases as well as cases where an imp is performing so poorly that is must be shut down quickly a type imp to host message will be transmitted to the host about seconds before the imp goes down finally of course there may be occasions when the imp crashes so quickly that no warning is given but the imp will never be intentionally shut down in this way mc quillan et al page rfc three aids to improved network operation july imp to host communication there have long been complaints that the imp to host error messages were not precise enough or were just plain ambiguous in rfc we proposed some additional error messages these and other imp to host message changes will be made on august and we encourage hosts to modify their ncp s as appropriate by then unmodified ncps will probably continue to work after this change but each site should look into this question carefully the table below lists all the imp to host messages and clearly indicates the changes which will be made type old meaning new meaning regular messages same error without error in leader of host to identification imp message bits imp s error flip flop set on the first bits of a host to imp message which the imp therefore cannot identify bits host to imp message too short less than bits bits illegal host to imp code imp going down imp going down bits coded as follows all bits zero going down in sec bits scheduled hardware pm bits scheduled software reload bits emergency reload or restart bits how soon the imp is going down in minute units bits how long the imp will be down in minute units blocked link unassigned mc quillan et al page rfc three aids to improved

operation july unassigned imp host interface reset the imp s ready line has been dropped and pending output to the host discarded probably because the host has not taken messages from the imp for a long time the imp will return a type message of subtype at the completion of the next host to imp message these changes can be summarized as follows there is now one and only one imp to host message in response to each host to imp regular message message types and now carry additional information message type has been added message types and have been discarded network news service we have instituted a network news service tip users get the news by typing the tip command news users of other host can get the news by icping to socket octal at the bbn tenex if you have further suggestions for improving the operation of the network we request your comments this rfc was put into machine readable form for entry into the online rfc archives by lorrie shiota mc quillan et al page
