electrical and electronics engineers inc general information on ieee workshops what is a workshop the objectives of these workshops are to clarify by exhaustive and off the record discussion between active workers in the field the merits and disadvantages of controversial alternative approaches to a specific phase of computer organization and to establish the basis for a group of high quality papers for ieee meetings and publications the workshop involves four key concepts small number of participants to permit exhaustive discussion off the record proceedings to allow discussion of incomplete and preliminary results selected mature participants to obviate the need for tutorial and introductory material a carefully defined topic to keep the discussion in focus off the record meetings to permit discussion of incomplete and tentative results information at the workshop cannot be published slides or blackboards may not be photographed so the workshop does not constitute disclosure in the sense of the patent law after the meeting participants are encouraged to publish significant contributions selected participants by limiting the workshop to a small number of active workers mature scientists knowledgeable in the specific area under discussion formal papers can be displaced by brief opening statements followed by an open discussion crocker page rfc computer networks may general information on ieee workshops page publication of results one measure of the success of a workshop is the resulting publication of research while the workshop itself is closed it should serve as a stimulus to generate a series of high quality papers for subsequent open meetings session organization the workshop is divided into four scheduled sessions each centered on one phase of the problem to be discussed normally the workshop chairman will assign to each session chairman the task of clarifying the subsidiary questions to be discussed in his session each session is divided into talks the speakers are designated as discussion leaders most participants at the workshop will be discussion leaders at one of the sessions the session chairman will attempt to provide each speaker with the time he requests within limits normally five to ten minutes will be allowed for formal presentation with to minutes reserved for discussion and debate in addition the chairman may include a general discussion period at the end of the session crocker page
