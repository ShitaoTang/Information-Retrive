 network working group r thomas request for comments bbn n i c may mltnet a multi telnet subsystem for tenex introduction mltnet is a telnet like facility for tenex which enables a user to control a number of jobs running on different arpanet hosts it multiplexes the user s local console among the remote jobs mltnet is useful in applications which require coordinated behavior of several network hosts in particular we have found it helpful in debugging programs which make use of the network the mltnet program is designed to be easy to use and while used in remote mode to be as transparent as possible to the user it is somewhat less sophisticated than the tenex user telnet program mltnet is currently a subsystem on the bbn tenex host using mltnet mltnet operates in two modes local mode operation when in local mode mltnet interprets input types by the user as commands to it commands consist of a mnemonic command name followed by zero or more parameters included in the commands recognized by mltnet are ones which enable the user to associate a name of his choice with a connection to an arpanet site to establish a connection with a named site to list the network status as seen from the user s tenex etc remote mode operation when operating in remote mode mltnet makes the user s console appear to be directly connected to a remote site it transmits input typed by the user to the remote site and prints output recieved from the remote site output received from a remote site while the user is in local mode or is interacting with another remote site is buffered for the user by mltnet mltnet has been designed to be transparent to the user while operating in remote mode in particular when in remote mode it transmits user types c control c the tenex attention character and t control t the tenex time used query character to the remote site page when in local mode c and t have their usual tenex effect occasinally a user may find it necessary to modify the characteristics of a connection to a particular remote site for example he may want to have mltnet echo typed input as it is transmitted or he may be using a remote host which requires both upper and lower case characters from a local terminal which has only upper case in such a case he would want mltnet to transmit upper and lower case as appropriate in remote mode operation mltnet recognizes as an escape character and interprets the character following it as a command to change the characterristics of the connection currently in use commands recognized by mltnet in remote mode are summerized in the next section to have mltnet transmit to the remote site the user types mltnet command summary local mode commands mltnet uses the character to signal the user that it is in local mode ready to accept input commands and command parameters may be editted as they are input the character a control a deletes the last character input in response to a a mltnet types deleted the character r control r causes the input string as collected so far to be retyped with all editting carried out mltnet responds to the character rubout octal by aborting the current input collecting operation and typeing the ready character the altmode character octal may be used to invoke command recognition and completion if insufficient information is availble to recognize an input string as a command mltnet responds to altmode by ringing the terminal bell any prefix which uniquely identifies a command is recognized as that command by mltnet in the following and denote command parameters they are strings terminated by a space or carriage return is a user chosen string of characters or less site is either the name of an arpanet host or the string local the commands recognized by mltnet in local mode are assign syntax assign effect associates the user chosen string with a connection to the arpanet site page talk syntax talk effect switches from command mode to remote mode directing subsequent console input to the site associated with if no arpanet site is currently associated with the user is asked to spesify a site the first time the user talks to a particular named site mltnet goes through the arpanet initial connection protocol with the remote site in order to establish a duplex connection with it names syntax names effect prints on the console the associatins currently known to mltnet quit syntax quit effect returns control to the tenex exec breaking all connections with remote hosts it is good practice to log out of each remote host before using the quit command netstat syntax netstat effect prints on the console the network status as seen from the local tenex rename syntax rename effect associates with the arpanet site previously associated with flush syntax flush effect breaks the network connection with the arpanet site associated with and in addition breaks the association between and that site hosts syntax hosts effect prints on the console the list of hosts currently known to the mltnet subsystem help syntax help page effect prints on the console a breif summary of how to use mltnet remote mode commands in remote mode mltnet recognizes the escape character as a signal to interpret the following character as a command currently mltnet recognizes the following characters as commands to it q quit causes mltnet to switch from remote mode to local mode l local echo causes mltnet to echo characters as it transmits them to the remote site l is the inverse of r the default case r remote echo causes mltnet to transmit characters typed to it without echoing them invers of l u upper case causes mltnet to transmit upper case letters as typed the inverse of s the default case s small letters lower case causes mltnet to transmit upper case letters typed to it as lower case letters in this mode of operation acts as a shift key may be transmitted by typing s is the inverse of u x where x is any character other than q l r u or s causes mltnet to transmit x the following is an annotated scenario which illustrates the use of mltnet in it characters typed by the users are underlined this rfc was put into machine readable form for entry into the
