 network working group b cosell request for comments bolt beranek and newman nic august host imp interface documentation on june we put a new version of the imp system version up in the network among other changes the new system corrected the problem of hosts receiving spurious destination dead type messages the correction involved making the imp refuse to accept any messages from its host for about seconds after the host indicated its intention to come alive this delay has caused trouble to a number of ncps because they had imposed an upper limit on the time an imp may take to accept a message and when that time was exceeded the imp was declared inoperative and the ncp shut itself down leaving the site personnel annoyed and perplexed we re sorry to have caused so much trouble but we thought that the new version modified no advertised property of the system to prevent misunderstandings of this type in the future the imp host interface should be well documented well understood and invariant the only way to set up and maintain such an interface is to presume that bbn report no is complete and correct we understand that it is neither but operating on the basis of this assumption is the best way to force to improve in our view the hosts should proceed under the constraint that anything not specifically guaranteed by does not exist and should not be used if there are problems using this approach please don t code around the problem or treat your imp as a black box and extrapolate its characteristics from a series of experiments instead send your comments and problems to the ncc at bbn and we will fix the imp system or whichever is necessary we are at the moment working n an update to it will reflect the deletion of the cease mechanism as per rfc we are also considering augmenting the imp host protocol with a mechanism to allow a host to detect a change in the version of the imp system and to provide the hosts with status information as to who is alive in the net this rfc was put into machine readable form for entry into the online rfc archives by ryan kato cosell page
