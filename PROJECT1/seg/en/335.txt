 network working group a mckenzie request for comments bbn updates rfc s january initial connection protocol a review of the initial connection protocol icp first described in rfc and restated in rfc has revealed an area of ambiguity which in turn reflects an ambiguity in the host host protocol document no this is the definition of the message sent over the connection from server socket in both referenced rfc s the message is defined as exactly an even bit number it is not clear however whether this bit number is meant to follow an eight bit message data type code or not stemming from the fact that the host host protocol makes provision for such codes but does not seem to absolutely demand them only one implementation of an icp has been documented in the nwg literature that at ucsb rfc the implementers of this icp have apparently interpreted the host host protocol as demanding a message data type code and therefore do transmit a code of zero steve crocker indicates private communication that the host host protocol was intended to require a message data type code we therefore recommend that rfc numbers and be amended to show that the even bit number is preceded by a message data type code of zero zero is the only code currently defined this rfc was put into machine readable form for entry into the online rfc archives by james thompson page
