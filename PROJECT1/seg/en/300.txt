 network working group steve crocker chairman request for comments at bbn cambridge nic february output of the host host protocol glitch cleaning committee at the nwg meeting in urbana on february a committee was established to look at the host host protocol and see what changes were immediately desirable or necessary the committee is chaired by steve crocker and has eight other members ray tomlinson bbn tenex jim white ucsb gary grossman illinois tom barkalow lincoln tx will crowther bbn imps bob bressler mit dynamic modeling doug mckay ibm yorktown dan murphy bbn tenex a number of topics were discussed on some of these topics a consensus was reached on whether or not to recommend a change and if so what the change should be on the remaining topics specific alternatives were proposed but no consensus was reached the committee will immediately canvas the network community and gather reaction to its recommendations and the proposed alternatives the committee will then reconvene at ucla on march and decide on final recommendations steve crocker will then write document this sequence is in lieu of the change procedure outlined in nwg rfc crocker page rfc host host protocol glitch cleaning committee february specific recommendations the eco and erp command should each be bits long the err command should be bits long message data types should be eliminated third level protocol people may reinstate such a mechanism the cease mechanism should be discontinued a new pair of one byte commands rst reset and rrp reset reply should be added the rst should be interpreted as a signal to purge the ncp tables of any existing entries which arose from the sending host the rrp command should be returned to acknowledge receipt of the rst the host sending the rst may proceed after receiving either a rst or a rrp in return a rst may be returned if the second host comes up after the first host although it was suggested at the urbana meeting that connections should be full duplex the committee recommends against this change messages should be an integral number of bytes and the number of bytes and the byte size should be specified in each message the marking convention should be abandoned and the padding ignored the number of bytes in the message should be a bit number following the leader the byte size should be in the next bit field two suggestions were generated for the starting point of the text and these are explained in the next session for flow control purposes the number of bits in a message is the product of the number of bytes and the byte size the leader and other fixed format fields are not counted the problem of synchronizing the interrupt signal in a console input stream was considered we consider the console input scanner as a process and note two reasonable implementations it may either read characters as fast as it can looking for the interrupt character and throwing away characters if there is no room in the user process input queue it may read characters only as fast as the user process can receive them or at least has room for them the first implementation guarantees that the interrupt character e g control c on the pdp will always be acted on but requires that the using process interpret the output stream to detect crocker page rfc host host protocol glitch cleaning committee february when it is sending too fast the second implementation avoids overrun but may not allow for sending an interrupt code note that in the first case allocation is alway renewed as soon as possible by the console input interpreter whereas in the second case allocation is renewed only as the result of acceptance of data by the user process we decided that this is really a third level protocol matter viz use the ins to mean that a special code has been inserted into the input stream in conjunction with this create the special code to be put into the input sequence this special code would be network wide and independent of the particular interrupt character peculiar to the serving system the scheme for interrupting a serving process is that the using process inserts the serving host s interrupt sequence followed by the network special code and also issue the ins unresolved alternatives length of control messages in accordance with other specifications control messages should be an integral number of bit bytes the length should be specified in the byte count field and control commands should not be split across messages unresolved was whether to specially limit the length of control messages the two choices are a no special limit bytes b bytes message format it was agreed to abandon marking and include the text length in the form of a byte count and byte size unresolved was where to begin the first byte of data the two choices are a have the first data byte begin after bits of leader byte count byte size and spacing the message format would then be as in the diagram crocker page rfc host host protocol glitch cleaning committee february leader byte count byte size beginning of first data byte b use the double physical transmission scheme presented in nwg rfc when sending a regular message the host would send a leader byte count and byte size and terminate transmission the second transmission would be the data at the receiving end the imp would transmit bits of leader byte count byte size and spacing and stop transmission the next transmission would be only the data allocation with respect to the allocation mechanism embodied in the all gvb and ret commands two alternatives were proposed a make no change b the flow control algorithm should be changed to keep track of two quantities messages and bits the all gvb and ret commands each have two data fields the all command allocates a message limit and a bit limit the gvb command contains two fractions and the ret command returns both messages and bits when sending a message the sending ncp decrements its message counter by and its bit counter by the text length of the message the sending ncp may not cause either of its counters to go negative the message counter would be bits long this rfc was put
