 network working group a bhushan request for comments mit mac nic april data and file transfer workshop notes on april and a data and file transfer workshop was held at m i t cambridge mass a list of attendees of the meeting for april and is appended to the notes this note attempts to summarize most of the topics discussed and all of the decisions reached at the workshop meeting the following is a summary of the talks and discussions on april steve crooker discussed a general theory for network protocols protocols transformations should have a unique inverse and should be transitive transformation to a standard form requires only n transformations n number of different types of hosts as compared with n n transformations with no standard form a standard approach is preferable for n for file transfer one could define a network virtual file image there was some discussion on whether it was possible to satisfy the above rules for file structure transformations no agreement was reached and the problem was abandoned for the present further discussion lead to the following formulation of the workshop goals to come up with data and file transfer protocol strategy that satisfies the needs of arpanet users including maxi hosts mini hosts tips datacomputer rje and mailbox users goals for the protocols strategy were set as it should preserve the integrity of data it should preserve the integrity of character representation and interpretation it should preserve the integrity of structural information to the extent conveniently possible it should lead to the development of a network virtual file system bhushan page rfc data and file transfer workshop notes april richard winter discussed the datacomputer application the datacomputer though usable from terminals directly will not be engineered for direct terminal users but for use by programs in datalanguage a user can define data and file structure and also how the file data is to be transferred using the data language it is possible to transfer entire files or only the relevant parts of files the following is an example of file transfer as currently envisioned in the datacomputer login create create port for transfer to datacomputer for transfer from datacomputer logout create statements are needed only when the description s required are not already on file at the datacomputer a port description can specify a standard external name thus making a port statement optional also external name is to be a host socket specification the data transfer is to be in accordance with network data transfer standards the file and port descriptions are to be in datalanguage alex mckenzie discussed the tip user needs describing the current capabilities and limitations of tips and tip terminals telnet format is the first choice of tip users followed by dtp using the indefinite bit stream mode there are two tips with magnetic tape systems which are capable of transferring data between them using the current dtp rfc in the descriptor count mode utilizing sequence number option bob braden discussed the rjs protocol and presented some data on rjs use netrjs is of ccn job load representing jobs sessions and hours connect time in the last months average job input is of the order of bits cards average job output is bits lines large files have about million bits representing about minutes of transmission time the rjs protocol will be defined in a forthcoming document ray tomlinson described the cpynet system bbn is using to transfer files among tenex systems cpynet commands are ascii strings with a fixed syntax the original connection is closed after a command is accepted and data is transferred on a new connection using previous socket number but with possibly a different byte size the data transfer rate achieved in cpynet has been about kb s bhushan page rfc data and file transfer workshop notes april abhay bhushan discussed the evaluation of network protocols and presented some preliminary measurement results the evaluation criteria for protocols should include speed real time delay and transmission rate efficiency cpu time or cost reliability error rate and failure rate convenience ease of use and implementation and usage suitability for various application and user classes the parameters that affect speed and efficiency for given system conditions fixed load etc are byte size used for ncp connection average message size used for transmission data format conversion e g into network ascii dtp blocks etc buffer size and i o mode used unit or block mode etc other protocol constraints acknowledge error checking connection procedure etc there was some discussion as to how data and file transfer protocols may be altered to make transfer faster and more efficient by using optimum byte size and minimizing some of the constraints that impose a large overhead the follow up discussions on dtp and ftp lead to a list of discussion and decision items for the next day the following is a summary of decisions reached on saturday april separate connections are to be used for data and control information control connection is to be a telnet full duplex connection nvt ascii established via the icp data connections are to be simplex connections established directly the file transfer and file system commands and their arguments shall be printable ascii strings instead of numeric codes so that they are directly usable by a user at a terminal the interaction however will be optimized for usage by programs indirect use the byte size and user socket for data connection data representation and transfer mode to be used in file transfer may be chosen by a user via one or more commands requiring a positive or negative acknowledgment bhushan page rfc data and file transfer workshop notes april the following data representations are to be accepted by all servers network ascii bit ascii in bit field with th bit zero local byte a server option to store data in an efficient manner the storage scheme should be well publicized image a sequence of bits which should be stored contiguously independent of the byte size chosen for transfer ascii print file convert ascii file to a form suitable for printing ebcdic print file convert ebcdic file to a form suitable for printing record structures are allowed but not mandatory a user with no record structure in his file should be able to store or retrieve his file at any host if a serving host cannot accept record structure it must inform the user of the fact any record structure information in the data stream may subsequently be discarded the following data transfer modes are defined byte stream end of file indicated by closing connection no record structure block file is series of blocks preceded by a count field appropriate means provided to indicate end of file end of record and restart markers ascii the file is network ascii end of record and end of file are indicated by a special telnet control character with th bit set to one file is network ascii with an end of record defined by cr lf and end of file by closing connection hasp compressed file with end of record and end of file information bhushan page rfc data and file transfer workshop notes april a restart procedure will be provided to protect user from system failures either host or process dying the issue of bits lost or scrambled is handled best at the ncp level standard error codes and responses will be provided for storage and i o channel errors at the ftp level the restart procedure would require that the sender of data insert a special marker in the data stream the marker has meaning only to the sender it could be bit count record count or page count etc the receiver of data would mark the corresponding position of this marker in its own system and return this information to the user in the event of a system failure the user can restart the transfer by supplying this information with a restart command dtp is no longer a separate protocol but a set of transfer modes or format procedures whose use is defined by the file transfer protocol abhay bhushan will write the workshop notes and the draft specifications for the new file transfer protocol list of attendees data and file transfer workshop abhay bhushan mit mac april bob braden ucla ccn april arvola chan mit mac april steve
