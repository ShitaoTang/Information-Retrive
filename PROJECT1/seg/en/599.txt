 nwg rfc dec what we hope is an official list of host names richard w watson sri arc the enclosed is what we hope will be accepted as a list of official formal host names and nicknames as no other subject worked on by the nwg has generated so much comment it is worthwhile to review briefly how this list came into being the need for some standard set of names recognized by ncp s and telnets and usable on hardcopy to designate a persons affiliation had been recognized for some time and several sets of names were in use peggy karp issued the first formal proposal of a set of standard names in rfc nic this proposal was answered by a number of counter proposals and culminated in rfc nic people still were not happy with this proposal as names normally associated with hosts or projects were not used at the last nwg meeting a number of people discussed the name problem and agreed that the only reasonable compromise solution was to have both formal names and nicknames and to let the people at the hosts choose their own names within the guideline which the previous dialog had seemed to agree on the guidelines were summarized in rfc nic and the nic agreed to collect and publish the names that the people at each host indicated they desired a number of names were received and a tentative list was published as rfc nic more people responded with their desired names or changed the ones in the above list almost all sites have since responded and the following list resulted i think people should feel free to change their host name when ever the situation warrants formal name nickname network address ames ames illiac i ames tip bbn ncc ncc page nwg rfc dec what we hope is an official list of host names bbn tenex bbn bbn tenexb bbnb bbn testip burr burr test case cmu etac tip gwc tip harv pdp harv acl harv ill ants ants ill cac cac ll ll tsp ll tx tx mccl mit ai mit dmcg dmcg mit multics mit m mitre tip nbs ccst nbs page nwg rfc dec what we hope is an official list of host names nbs tip ncar ncar tip radc radc tip rand csg rand rcc sdc adept sdc sri ai sri arc su ai tink ucla ccn ccn ucla nmc sex ucla mod ucsb usc usc tip utah this rfc was put into machine readable form for entry into the online rfc archives by bbn corp under the direction of alex mckenzie page
