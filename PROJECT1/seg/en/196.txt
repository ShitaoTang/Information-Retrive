 network working group john e kreznar request for comments sdc october two protocol suggestions to reduce congestion at swap bound nodes there is a wide variance in swap rates between core and auxiliary store among the host systems to be nodes in the arpa imp network the slower of these of which our system with drump swap store is an example might improve the utility of the network not only for themselves but for all nodes if the two protocol suggestions of this note were to be adopted host control of ordering of imp to host traffic imp host protocol now calls for delivery of messages from imp to host in the order in which the imp received them this may lead to wasted swapping if for example the imp has messages for its host s timeshare users a and b in that order at a time when user b is in host core b would have to be swapped out a in and the first message accepted only to discover that now a must be swapped out and b back in again if the host could a read the imp s queue of waiting messages and b accept them in the order it found most effective then a new mechanism for improvement of network efficiency would be at hand clearly this change would have an impact on bbn s imp software core to core transfers between hosts at another level perhaps not involving host imp protocol or imp software changes is a host host protocol wherein cooperating hosts agree to lock appropriate programs in core for the duration of a multi message file transfer on an auxiliary connection this could greatly reduce the time to transfer such a file to and from a swap bound host unfortunately the numbers mitigate possible advantages of this approach to some extent if we assume a kilobit sec line and support further that it is dedicated at efficiency to this transfer which may require slightly different handling of rfnms in this case this comes out to just over kilobit messages per second it may be impolitic in a timeshare environment to lock a single program in core for more than about seconds if this is the case then the method would be applicable only for the rather limited range of file sizes of messages nevertheless the time to move a large file could be so greatly enhanced by this approach that i think it deserves consideration abhi bhushan proj mac jerry cole sdc steve crocker ucla john kreznar ron stoughton ucsb dick linde elmer shapiro sri bob long page steve carr utah reg martin john haefner rand hal sackman paul rovner ll c weissman bob khan bb n marty bleier larry roberts arpa this rfc was put into machine readable form for entry into the online rfc archives by alex portnoy page
