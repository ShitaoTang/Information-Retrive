 network working group r watson request for comments j north nic stanford research institute arc april some network information center policies on handling documents introduction the network information center nic seeks to facilitate the flow of information between sites on the network and to and from other stations whose work makes them valuable as participants in the network dialog the nic is concerned both with the techniques for the flow and with optimizing the content of the information itself some aspects of the work of the nic in support of information flow are described here and some suggestions made to network participants of ways they can help this work all information handled by the nic is available to any network participant all information generated by the nic is unclassified and is without distribution limitation except as dictated by staff and budget size any information sent by an originating party to the nic for recording or distribution is presumed to be unclassified and without distribution limitations as well any statement carried by a document thus submitted which seems to imply a limitation on distribution quotation or citation is presumed not to apply to its handling by the network information center nic number one important function of the network information center is to make records of the existence of rfc s formal nic related manuals and reports network memos other network informational items and other informational items of interest to network participants and to index these records so that such items can be recalled when needed to tag the informational items a serial number is assigned by nic the serial number has no intrinsic meaning not even necessarily an indication of sequence of issue it is a unique identifier and can be used to refer to the item in further communications to facilitate indexing and to allow numeric filing of documents watson north page rfc policies on handling documents april use of the nic number has advantages in online dialog which are not yet demonstrable around the network but the cooperation of network participants in applying one when a document is originated is important the nic catalog items of information relevant to the network appear in many forms including technical reports rfc s brief network memos journal articles and letters reference to these is simplified by assignment of a nic number to each to record the item to which the nic number refers a description of each item using a set of standard data elements i e author title etc is coded and entered as an online system nls

collecting the statements coded z nic in the master catalog the data element z indicates which stations hold a copy of an item not all items related to nic are sent to stations and in the future it is expected that stations will submit many documents to nic for cataloging which are not held by other stations watson north page rfc policies on handling documents april nic catalog listings and indexes programs have been written at arc to collect sort analyze and format the statements and the data elements in the statements to produce catalogs and indexes such as those in the current catalog of the nic collection nic the current catalog of the nic collection is a functional document as explained in branch below it has as its contents at any time the current issue of a bibliography of items from the nic catalog called a nic catalog listing and author and keyword indexes examples of entries in the catalog listing and in indexes are shown using the statement above catalog listing by author an

separate listing or by a notation with each reference a number catalog or index serves as a shelf list of documents held by a station the indexes are not limited to the station collections but lead to the entire catalog data elements the data elements for information items include the author title addressee date other numbers keywords and abstract when these elements do not exist in the item they are supplied by a nic cataloger if possible in online communication around the network online dialog several of these elements of data will be recorded automatically lacking online recording it is important that originators of reports memos and other such items be diligent in including these data in their transmissions for memos essential data elements which the originator should supply are author s address es of author s addressee s address es of addressee s date of origination subject of memo a preassigned nic number is desirable a number for assignment can presently be obtained by calling nic and soon will be obtainable online the addressees of a memo can of course be a group such as the network working group or the glitch cleaning committee in which case the nic needs a list or reference to a list of the people in the group watson north page rfc policies on handling documents april for reports and other formal documents essential data elements are author s addresses of author s title date abstract keywords a short abstract to words giving some of the substance of the document is of importance in the nic record and even for the person about to read the document obviously a well written author abstract is preferable to one produced by the nic staff keywords supplied by the author preferably those from a standard thesaurus will be used in machine retrieval when such author assigned keywords are lacking the nic will supply some recommended sources for keywords are categories identified by peggy karp categorization and guide to nwg rfc s nic american national standard vocabulary for information processing ansi x nic department of defense thesaurus of engineering and scientific terms ad nic nasa thesaurus december nasa sp nic when a document being issued supercedes an earlier document this information is particularly important and should be supplied by the author subcollections groups of documents such as the nwg rfc s and the replies to sher s survey as well as the station collections are cataloged by nic as subcollections that is they are retrievable as a subset of the nic catalog which in turn is a subset of a master catalog at arc the capability of making subcollections is provided for network participants watson north page rfc policies on handling documents april to create a subcollection in the nic records a network participant will be able to indicate to nic the records he wishes to have so grouped and this information will be entered in the master catalog statement for the document for later retrieval functional documents several documents generated in network activities are subject to occasional revision and updating the nic catalog the directory of network participants and the directory of network resources are examples these and external documents such as the bbn manuals are referred to by nic as functional documents more generally a functional document is a document whose title and function remain constant but whose contents can change a functional document contains a single or several documents which can be added to deleted or replaced entirely or selectively thus the functional document which has a nic number can be referenced in other documents with some assurance that it will be in existence even though the subdocuments with their distinctive nic numbers may be in flux in the catalog the number of a functional document in which a specific document may be contained is listed and the current contents of each functional document is indicated in preparing a document which is expected to be revised network participants are urged to use a looseleaf format the network information center intends to support the distribution and recording of contents of functional documents procedures have been established as described below for fitting the changes to such documents into the nic system and for reproducing and distributing them to individuals or stations with instructions for their integration into the existing documents procedures for revision material original manuals and other functional document materials are reproduced and distributed by nic just as other network publications for all documents obtained through nic nic will attempt to receive and make distribution of updates nic also wants to make the processes of inserting the revisions and of recording the changes as easy and foolproof as possible the user should not only be given the current materials but should be able to determine the version he holds and to be able to refer to updates uniquely the following is copied from the procedure instructions watson north page rfc policies on handling documents april nic has written for its own use these procedures are also recommended to network participants for their use in preparing revision material to be sent to nic update conventions substantial revision of a bound document or of more than a few pages of a loose leaf document a new document will be published with a new nic number and will bear a notation under the number on the title page and or cover e g nic supercedes nic few pages inserted or revised in a looseleaf or corner stapled document each new or revised page will bear the original document number with a notice of revision e g nic inserted pages will be numbered to fit into the existing document e g pages may be inserted between pages and deleted pages will be replaced by a single page indicating the deletion e g pages deleted a new table of contents and or title page will be issued bearing the revision notice in addition at the time of each revision a page or pages will be prepared and issued which indicates all additions deletions and revisions which bring the document up to date revisions will be made only by substitution addition or deletion of a full page or more nic will not revise its own publications by lists of errata and strongly recommends against their use by others in the network however when nic receives such lists of errata it will reproduce and distribute them with suggestions to station agents for recording and inserting them watson north page rfc policies on handling documents april distribution and transmittal procedures the transmittal letter accompanying a set of revision material and the revision material itself constitute a separate document a copy of which is filed at nic where a new copy can be provided at any time the transmittal letter will indicate the appropriate information document number of the revision material date document number of the publication being updated its date and when practicable information on the changes made in the text revision notation in the printed catalogs and their indexes catalog entry supercession the data element containing superceded by nic xxxx will be formatted to appear at the beginning of the citation of the superceded document the data element containing supercedes nic xxxx will be formatted to appear following the abstract in the citation partial revision the data element containing the note of revision will be formatted to appear following the abstract entries in author titleworld or other indexes supercession the data element covering supercession will be the only text in the entry for the superceded document supercession will not be indicated in the entry for the superceding document partial revision partial revision will not be indicated in the index entry this rfc was put into machine readable form for entry into the online rfc archives by jay kominek watson north page
