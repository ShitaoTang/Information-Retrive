 network working group r t braden request for comments ucla ccn nic august categories obsoletes updates using tso at ccn ibm s time sharing option tso is now available at ccn for use via the network with telnet protocol tso is not yet considered production by ccn since there are a number of restrictions and glitches to be removed or documented however tso is now quite stable and is up on a regularly scheduled basis the system will allow an experienced programmer to work productively at ccn to use tso you will need a valid ccn charge billing number and a user id to obtain a charge number if you do not already have one or to obtain a tso user id contact barbara noble at or at present we are not charging for tso use although any batch jobs submitted from tso will be charged to your account barbara can assign on overhead charge number for experimental use of tso if you do not have a paid account modes of tso use conversational remote job entry using tso you can prepare an os job stream using the tso edit command submit the job to batch execution monitor its status and ship the output back to edit for examination this allows those of you with tip s to process jobs at ccn without using netrjs via a friendly tenex machine any batch job can be submitted this way foreground execution many os programs can be run with varying degrees of inconvenience directly from the terminal there are tso commands providing the facilities of exec and dd cards the output stream can be directed to the user s terminal there are some important limitations to fore ground operation however the foreground region size is limited at present it is k though this will be expanded page all datasets referenced must be on resident disk packs no disks or tapes can be mounted since you are time sliced and swapped it can be very slow there are two important cases of foreground execution a the test command provides ddt like debugging capability for foreground programs b the user s own program can interact with his terminal note it is not yet possible for a program either in batch or foreground to open direct network connections hours of operation monday through friday a m noon pdt or a m p m edt these hours will be extended before september telnet protocol the document using tso via arpa network virtual terminal rfc describes the use of a telnet nvt to access tso there are some signi ficant differences from using a real locally rfc describes the current server telnet complete with an annoying bug a later version will include the following capabilities not presently available a full duplex i e ccn echoing b lower case input c the special character translation included in netrjs users with model teletypes see rfc d optional specification of single cr or single lf as end of line indication e hopefully the input attention bug described in rfc will be fixed page disk space tso will automatically place datasets created in the foreground e g by edit or alloc on the proper resident disk pack all tso datasets are cataloged and can be referenced by name alone no volume or unit specifi cation is necessary for most purposes you can pretend we have one big disk dataset names the standard ibm version of tso uses the tso user id as the highest index of each dataset name at ccn the two highest levels are the charge number and the user id of the person who created the dataset tso has been modified accordingly dataset access control in general under tso a user can access for reading writing or execution any dataset named with the charge number with which he is logged on in addition he can rename or scratch any dataset with the logon charge number there is no provision for public or read only datasets a present logging on most network users will need only the simple form of logon logon example notes user logon uid use your user id tso logon uid tso repeats line for reasons of its own tso enter password tso asks for password user xyz tso uid logon in progress at on august page tso logon proceeding it may take a while this message will come every seconds tso welcome to tso good luck tso ready user id s are created in tso with a blank password to add or change your password use the change command if you have tso access under more than one charge number logon will prompt you for the charge number to be used for the session where to get help to obtain a list of tso commands enter help commands to get detailed information on syntax and function of a particular command enter help type help help for details the send command may be useful for on line help from pcn pete nielsen or wdd bill drain when they are signed on you can find out if pcn or wdd is on by sending them a trial message example user send hello user wdd tso user wdd not logged on tso ready user send hello user pcn tso ready user send edit is acting funny user pcn tso ready here pcn was logged on and got your message you can therefore converse with him through send the text in one send is limited to characters you can also leave a message for wdd to receive when he logs on by typing send user wdd logon page to send a message to the ccn operator enter simply send you can call the ccn telephone consultant at monday through friday during the hours a m pdt and p m except p m on thursday if the consultant does not know the answer he she will investigate and call you back you can call the general contact for network user problems barbara noble at barbara is also one of the telephone consultants if all else fails call bill drain the ccn systems programmer in charge of tso installation his telephone is if no answer call my secretary at and leave a message for bill you can also send a message to someone at ccn by submitting the following pseudo job through rjs at tso job bin msglass c etc this rfc was put into machine readable form for entry into the online rfc archives by bbn corp under the direction of alex mckenzie page
