 work information center g hicks request for comments utah nov user ftp documentation the attached document is the help file for the utah implementation of the user ftp process this is what the user has typed on his console when he types help and as such is the only documention produced to date page user ftp documentation detailed command listing ftp user documentation november i control characters there are several control characters that have meaning to the ftp process first the abort character is sub next for editing only and have any meaning soh and bs are the character delete keys is the word delete character note when dowing the funktion this character will delete the entire line typed says take the next character literally esc terminates the command giving helpful noise words and are terminators also these last two will give no command completion or noise words all three echo as a space however can and del are the command abort characters dc will retype the line as the command interpreter sees it when using the as a prompter for initial commands it will type out all commands that begin with that particular character string if it is typed in a sub command field it will type out the prompt message only if it is the first character typed at all other times it will be accepted as part of the typed string ii general information the ftp user process is designed to make transferring files from one host on the arpanet to another much easier than it has been up until now to this end the command language was designed to be as natural as possible the command interpreter is of course part of this idea therefore to help the user as much as possible there are several ways to find out what is expected in the form of commands file names user names etc when the user has typed nothing typing a will cause the interpreter to type out all the commands that are available to the user if the user has typed anything at all then it will respond with all commands that begin with the particular character string so that the command language was as easy to learn as possible the command interpreter will see nothing that is not part of a legal command if the user types anything that is not expected the character is not echoed and a bell is echoed instead page user ftp documentation detailed command listing iii brief command listing the commands that are expected and their syntax are listed below note upper and lower case letters are identical d useful for comments to a person that is linked to you mode retreive to get to send to store to append to rename to be delete bye copy to see detailed description below logout ddt list to file socket not implemented yet allocate quit foreign host host user password account status see description of status command below login byte type structure tenex ascii verbose page user ftp documentation detailed command listing iv detailed description of the commands the commands and their syntax are described in greater detail blow the words in parenthesis are noise words note upper and lower case are identical unless otherwise noted in the command description all commands described are implemented or performs the icp to the indicated host with explanatory remarks if the icp is not possible mode sets the mode of the data transfer connection according to the following sub commandos stream bit stream end of file is indicated by the data connection closing block formats or expects formatted data into blocks text sends or retreives text forces type ascii and byte this command sends the appropiate commands to the foreign host then sends the data using the telnet codes for eor and eof as per the ftp protocol hasp compress data note of the above sub commands only mode stream and mode text are implemented at present retreive file to file sends the retr command to the remote server sets up the data connection according to any previous mode type byte commands puts the data coming on the the data connection into the local file specified get file to file see description of retreive store local file onto file accepts a local file name does the formatting according to any previous byte type mode commands and sends it to the foreign host send local file onto file see description of store append local file to remote file does the same as a store except that the file is appended to the page user ftp documentation detailed command listing remote file rather that just writing over the file rename existing file to be accepts the name of n old remote file and asks for a new file name sends the appropiate commands and names to the foreign host causing the old file name to be replaced by the new file name delete file this command causes the remote file to be marked for deletion it does require that the command be confirmed twice bye takes no arguments causes the server to terminate the current session with the user the program will return to the exec mode when the command has been acknowledged by the remote server copy this command does a variety of things first it allows the user do describe a file group eg mac sav etc the s may be for foreign files or local files according to the following sub commands remote remote file group causes the user ftp to ask the server for the file in then asks the user to specify where each file is to go a typical sequence might look like the following copy remote remote file group ftp please be patient getting remote file names got them copy file ftp mac to file ftp mac new file messages and etc follow with the above line being repeated for each file in the remote file group local local file grouping causes the user ftp to accept the file group specified and send the file names to the server leaving off the and version number of the local file the user may not specify d devices of d directorys a line for this might look like the following copy local local file group ftp confirm next if the user does not specify any s for either the remote file or the local file this command is exactly like the retreive or store command described earlier logout takes no arguments see description of bye command for more details page user ftp documentation detailed command listing reset takes no arguments causes the user process to close all connections if necessary all files if necessary and reset the programs parameters to their defaults ddt if ddt is loaded just starts ddt if ddt is not loaded it will load ddt and then start it at its initial start up location this command will casue an abnormal interrupt if ddt is not found list file group to file esentially causes the remote server to do a directory command the default is and since the listing will come on the data connection the user must specify a local file a sample line might look like the following list file group going to file tty ok socket will accept a socket descriptor for the data to go to or come from at present it is not implemented because we have not decided on the format of the command to the server allocate accepts as its argument a decimal number of bytes of the specified size telling the server how many bytes of storage to reserve for the next store of append quit takes no arguments returns the console to the exec the program may be continued with no harm done this command allows the user to send arbitrary strings to the remote server at present when talking to a tenex site it is only useful for doing the mail command other sites may have help commands of whatever host allows the user to specify an arpanet host without actually connecting to the host this specified host will be the ont that is connected to or the attempt will be made anyway when the next immediate command is executed eg login retreive store list etc user name is sets the user name for the remote system useful for systems that require no password for the specified name does nothing until an user must be logged into the remote system the programm knows this and so will not let the user execute any commands retreive store append list status rename delete until he has at least specified a remote user name the login command does this as does this command page user ftp documentation detailed command listing status of the at host accepts as its argument one of the following sub commands service at host attempts to perform the icp to the specified host does not disturb any existing connections see description of status service above status of file similar to the list command described above except that the listing does not gone back on the data connection but on the telnet connection see list command for more details just sneds the stat command typically is good for finding out where your are and perhaps who you are password is sets the password for the remote user s name it is not echoed and does nothing until the next immediate command is executed account is accepts a string of number that can be charged for any activity the user specifies eg store retreive or append useful only for systems that require this information of course also does nothing until the next immediate command is executed login the format of this command is identical to the tenex login command it accepts a user name password and an optional account number if no host has been specified it will ask for the host to be connected to this command will cause the icp to take place if necessary byte size is this command sets the byte size for the data connection the default byte size is bytes type is takes as its argument one of the following subcommands tenex shorthand that sets type image and byte ebcdic says that the data will be ebcdic print says that the data is an ascii print file with asa vertical format controls local forces the user and server ftp to accept whatever byte size the user has specified for the present this type is treated the same as for image type image does the same as local just forces the user and server ftp to accept the specified byte size without doing any translation as is done for ascii type for most efficient usage of this command the page user ftp documentation detailed command listing matching byte size should be byte when using tenex sites as servers ascii sets type ascii and bit bytes useful for text files note of the above sub commands only print and ebcdic are not implemented yet structure is accepts as its argument one of the following sub commands redord says the data on the data connection has record structure information contained in it note since tenex not support record structured files per se this mode only useful for sending text files to or retreiving text files from non tenex sites the in these files is converted to the telnet eor code for transmission and eor to etc for reception file says the data stream has no record structure information in it tenex see description under type tenex ascii see description under type ascii verbose this command sets the command completion no completion flag the program assumes the no verbose mode and thus does not complete commands when or is used as a command terminator it also causes the noise words to be typed if in the verbose mode page user ftp documentation detailed command listing v sample session using the ftp the following scenario shows some uses of the ftp everything that the user types is underlined
