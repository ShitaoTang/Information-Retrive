 received at nic sept network working group j mcquillan rfc bbn net nic september response to rfc cross country network bandwidth this note serves as a brief correction to several fundamental errors in rfc by l peter deutsch not all packets are bits long this is basic to the network design rfnms are bits long bits of hardware framing and bits of software identification and addressing host host protocol messages such as single characters and allocates are bits long bits of host protocol bits for the character or all and an additional bits of imp software header this totals to bits in each direction not the number of single character messages that can be supported is therefore over per second not per second not only is such a traffic pattern unlikely but it can be supported in the imp subnetwork much more readily than in most hosts furthermore if the demand for remote echoing ever exceeds network capacity the tips and hosts can simply buffer characters per message doubling the effective bandwidth of the network of course dozens of characters can be packed into a single message with nearly proportional increases in effective bandwidth given the size of the overhead this buffering happens automatically and incrementally with increasing load as the natural consequence of slowed responses it is most likely that the poor echoing response cited by deutsch is not caused by peak network loads if echoing was coming in character bursts there would have to be characters per second coming from users of remote echo systems to use all the capacity of kilobit paths this reasoning points up the more serious error in rfc the problems associated with bad echo response are delay problems not bandwidth in designing the imp software we have used a bimodal model of traffic and attempted to provide low delay for interactive rfc traffic and high throughput rates for bulk data transfers it is pointless to try for high data rates with short messages the overhead in bits and also in imp and host processor wake ups is too high the primary factor in echoing performance is delay as an extreme example echoing over a megabit per second satellite link will lag a second or more behind input with no bandwidth limitations at all we agree that changes to telnet protocol may well improve performance by reducing network traffic and more importantly reducing demands for host processing in cases of network paths with long delay especially satellite links such changes are essential for interactive echoing jmcq jm this rfc was put into machine readable form for entry into the online rfc archives by alex mckenzie with support from gte formerly bbn corp
