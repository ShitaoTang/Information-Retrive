 network working group abhay k bhushan rfc mit dmcg nic february ftp comments and response to rfc most of the comments in rfc by bob braden are useful suggestions which should be included in the forthcoming official ftp specification this rfc represents my response to braden s comments and other views these comments should be useful for the ftp meeting on march at bbn announcement warning aam nic the results of the ftp subgroup meeting held at bbn on january will be published in rfc are published specific responses to rfc item a i will let bob braden handle the print file issues the still should be removed item a i agree that concessions are undesirable and should be removed unless people cannot live without them item a i strongly support bit flag coding for descriptors other definition improvement suggestions are ok too item a the diagram was useful an alternate one is given on page of rfc i prefer the latter item a the ftp may not be privileged enough to alter passwords in many host systems e g multics i know that ccn allows changing passwords on line we can define a format for changing passwords in the pass command but i don t think we can require that all servers allow password changing this is a minor problem that can be easily solved item a yes the comment that type should be before byte was for bad implementations the server should reject data transfer parameters only when the data transfer command is received the order of the parameter change commands is not important item a i do agree that ncp s should be fixed a socket number reply should be required at a specific time and ncp s should be able to provide it this also permits the proposed gsoc command let us find out at next meeting if there is anyone who cannot live with this new requirement bhushan page rfc ftp comments and response to rfc february item a yes item b there are at least two ways to solve the ftp parameter encoding problem presented by bob braden one is to allow multiple letter in the type command as suggested by bob and the other is to have a new command such as form which could be p or u other solutions are equally acceptable to me item c our emphasis should be on working protocol as well as elegance i like the proposed gsoc command over the listen in fact gsoc can be used for all data connection security checking the reply should be sent with gsoc only and the server should use only those sockets for data connection item d we need more discussion on the issue of site dependent ftp parameters i will put it on the agenda for the forthcoming ftp meeting further comments the command reply sequence needs to be tightened in both specification and implementations to allow convenient use of ftp by programs or automatons a reply greeting upon first connecting to the ftp server should be required and not optional this avoids the programs having to wait an arbitrary time for such a greeting before issuing commands commands may only be sent after the reply is received from the server rfc needs a discussion of transfer between two ftp servers arranged by the user via the lstn or gsoc commands perhaps we should allow specification of data transfer parameters in a single command line for reasons of efficiency a suggested format is to have separate the parameters bunched together in a single line requiring only a single reply consider the following sequences stru f type i byte mode s reply ok further discussion of mail and mail file commands seems necessary perhaps we will get some useful input from the mail meeting at sri on february the following issues seem particularly relevant to me a allowing mail to multiple users it should be required that ftp servers allow this bhushan page rfc ftp comments and response to rfc february b using nic idents ftp servers should accept some standard form of user name this could be nic idents or last name with optional use of initials c uniform conventions for who the mail is from day time etc and how the mail is delivered to user the mail usually gets tagged twice or sometimes not tagged at all perhaps we need a different mechanism for indicating who the mail is from than provided by the user command d handling bulk or junk mail particularly the nic documents that may be sent on line by the nic perhaps mail file should put a file in user s directory and notify him of the same the user does not see all the junk on his console but can print the file on a printer and read that class of mail at his leisure this rfc was put into machine readable form for entry into the online rfc archives by alex mckenzie with support from gte formerly bbn corp bhushan page
