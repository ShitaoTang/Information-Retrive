 network working group h brodie request for comments ucla nmc nic computer science categories d d october updates none obsoletes none some thoughts on file transfer there are several aspects of the proposed data transfer protocol rfc and file transfer protocol rfc which we believe could use further clarification and perhaps revision interest in transferring larger amounts of data than is typically sent via the usual telnet connection is increasing and at least at ucla nmc implementation attempts have pointed out several difficulties with the proposed protocols first and probably most easily decided is the ambiguity in rfc with regards to the sequence number field of the descriptor and count transaction the description provided for the transaction header provides for bit sequence number however the sequence number field in the error codes transaction only provides for bits we are of the opinion that bits is sufficient for a sequence number field if the sequence number is reduced to bits and the two nul bytes are deleted from the descriptor and count header then its size is reduced to bits which would seem to be as convenient to handle as the proposed bit transaction header another source of difficulty lies in the implementation of the the sex time sharing system the end of a file which presumably would be the begin point of an append transaction is almost com pletely context defined i e the program reading the file determines when it has reached the end of the file therefore the meaning of append is somewhat hazy and since the proposed mail box protocol uses the append feature not implementing this command in a file transfer service is costly in terms of lost useability we believe that resolution of these ambiguities will lead to a greatly accelerated implementation schedule at least here at ucla nmc this rfc was put into machine readable form for entry into the online rfc archives by bbn corp under the direction of alex mckenzie page
