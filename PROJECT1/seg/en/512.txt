 network working group m a padlipsky request for comments mit multics nic april what is free in at least three of the rfc s about mail and the file transfer protocol rfc s something very like the following is asserted network mail should be free i e no login or user command should be required unfortunately i e that is is misleading it simply does not follow to imply that the only way mail can be free is for it not to require a login explicit login on a free account would of course also work indeed depending upon per host idiosyncrasies in the logger answering service process creation environment an explicit login may well prove to be far more natural than an implicit login even in environments where implicit login is easy surely explicit login is just easy granted login on a free account requires users to remember the name of the free account however this would not be too great a burden to bear if there were reasons for preferring an explicit login and if the free account had the same name on all hosts therefore from the promise that network protocols should not implicitly legislate unnatural implementations for participating hosts if it is conveniently avoidable i propose the following formulation network mail should be free network mail should not require users to remember the name of the free account on a given system i e it should either be loginless or it should take the same login everywhere but some systems need want prefer a login therefore user netml pass netml should be made to work everywhere for free mail note netml is fewer than six characters and is upper case hence it should fit in the least common denominator category of user identifiers but it s still long enough not to conflict with anybody s initials in all probability now because of the implementation implications this may all sound like special pleading but i claim that another implication of the incorrect formulation will further show the superiority of an explicit login for mail for the loginless view leads to problems in regard to the authentication aspects of login and the accounting aspects by apparently assuming that the sole purpose of login is to initiate accounting in rfc the problem is exposed when after noting that some systems allow access control to be applied to mailboxes it is asserted that ftp user command is wrong for access control because you d then be on the free account and a new ftp from padlipsky page rfc what is free april command would be right presumably from would be followed by pass being reasonably familiar with one of the systems which does allow access control on mailboxes let me point out how it works permissible principal identifiers are placed on the access control list of the mailbox and when the mailbox is referenced by a process the principal identifier of that process must match explicitly or as a member of a class an entry on the list or access will be forbidden but the principal identifier is associated with the process at login now it is probably a valid objection to say that accounting should be separated from authentification but it isn t always so why invent a redundant mechanism based on the assumption that it is another point on authentication via login it has been argued that ftp mail ought to be so cheap that it can be buried in overhead by the same token if it s so cheap it shouldn t bother anybody to login on his own account if he wants to prove the mail s from himself to be scrupulous i should close by mentioning the possibility that netml might be repugnant to some hosts if such be the case then i propose that a new ftp free command be introduced so that servers need not recognize mail as an implicit login the reasons here are at least twofold first it appears that when the subcommands to mail get worked out some of them will have to precede the mail or users will set awfully tired of typing their names etc therefore the list of commands which imply a login grow and grow and server ftp s will have to change and change second if mail implies a login it will be hard in some environments to get the arguments across to the process created on behalf of the mailer and it is not a good idea at all to assume that the mailing can be handled by the process which is listening on socket even introducing a new mechanism and see rfc for my strong feelings against that sort of step in general in free seems better than making all the assumptions that the loginless alternative does note that an alternative to this whole line of reasoning would be simply to observe that the ftp is internally inconsistent in that it acknowledges on the one hand in the definition of the user command that some systems may require user pass and then mis states on the other hand in the discussion of mail that they may not if this abstract point is more satisfying to some readers than the foregoing pragmatic argument well and good this rfc was put into machine readable form for entry into the
