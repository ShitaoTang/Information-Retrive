 network working group r merryman request for comments ucsd cc nic july the ucsd cc server ftp facility introduction the ucsd computer center is a service site that must support itself by charging for the usage of its facilities because of this the prospective user of our server ftp must supply a valid usercode user and password pass before any further ftp commands are accepted through ftp you are allowed to access or store files on our disk or on any of our or track tape drives each individual file transfer is handled by a separate process on the b and the user is charged for the processor i o core and if any tape charges incurred by this process note that these charges are quite minimal each of these transfer processes is given a separate job number and is therefore billed separately for each transfer by our accounting system please note that we have implemented ftp as defined in rfc july except as noted ftp commands user as mentioned you must supply a legal known ucsd cc user code following which the message will be given asking for the corresponding password pass after the user command is accepted you must then enter the pass command giving the corresponding password if the usercode and password are of correct form if they match if there is money in your account if your account is active and if you are authorized for q service then you will be properly logged on and the response will be returned byte we allow only the default byte size of all others will be rejected merryman page rfc the ucsd cc server ftp facility july mode we only allow the default mode of s stream all others will be rejected type we allow a ascii and i image types all others will be rejected as in standard ftp a is default stru we allow both f file and r record structuring record structuring is meaningful only in ascii stream where crlf is used as end of line when using record structuring in a stor to us if an incoming record is longer than the maxrecsize of the designated b file then we close the data connection issue a reject message and abort the local b transfer process if a record of incoming data is shorter than the specified maxrecsize of the file then the record is filled out with blanks in type ascii or with nulls in type image with image of course this applies only to the last record of the b file as in standard ftp f is default allo we have taken the liberty with the ftp protocol of using the allo command to enable the user to designate the b file attributes of his ucsd file the ftp standard form of allo is ignored i e allo n where n is some integer although a response will be returned in this case our special form is where the allo verb is immediately followed by a which is in turn followed by a parenthesized list of standard b file attributes as used on b label equate cards following is an example of this usage allo kind tape maxrecsize myuse out title xyz if this form of the allo command is not given prior to a stor then the file will have the name given prior in the stor command and will have the same characteristics as a standard cande type data disk file i e where maxrecsize blocksize areas areasize if no special allo is given preceding a retr then the file attributes are those of the file itself as it exists on the disk and are not altered in cases where the special allo is given prior to a transfer the name of the file is determined by the title attribute and the name given as the pathname of the stor or retr command is ignored if no title is merryman page rfc the ucsd cc server ftp facility july specified in an allo then the internal filename of localfile is used with the file attribute list form of the allo command the user has much of the same liberty to govern file characteristics as he does in using a label equate card with a normal b job for information concerning the available file attributes and their possible values please contact the ucsd cc consultant additionally you must remember that when doing a stor to a tape at ucsd you must specify myuse out in the file attribute list of the allo command also when transferring to or from tapes at ucsd you must make prior arrangements with our operators over telnet to locate and mount the tape we will soon implement a means whereby you may communicate with the operators directly through ftp xline this special command sets record structuring in our server ftp without the foreign user having to use a stru r command which may be rejected by his own host system this is specifically useful when transferring text files between ucsd and tenex s which do not implement record structuring i e if we are sending we will append crlf s to the end of each line of text we do not store these in the file and will store a line upon receiving data when a crlf is seen stripping the crlf entering xline off will restore file structuring on our end retr stor as specified in standard ftp except as modified by the special allo command see part appe not implemented at this time but will be in near future dele rnto rnfr not implemented it is suggested that to perform these functions the user log to our telnet server cande invoke the libmaint program simply type libmaint and say remove file name or change file name to file name say bye in order to exit libmaint merryman page rfc the ucsd cc server ftp facility july abor bye as specified in standard ftp except that until further notice a bye given while a transfer is in progress will not be queued for action following the transfer any commands not mentioned above are not yet implemented this rfc was put
