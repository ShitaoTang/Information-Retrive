 network working group marshall d abrams request for comments national bureau of standards nic july references nic serving remote users on the arpanet problem statement second only to the unavailability of the serving host the most vexing problem encountered in attempting to use the service hosts on the net has been the inadequacy of administrative procedure and information dissemination for remote users this paper explores the problem and proposes solutions when computer systems begin to service remote users some of the operating procedures which produced a functioning environment for local users may not be satisfactory for those who are off site it may be that these procedures were already inadequate but the local community developed a set of informal procedures to augment the formal ones it may also be true that the established formal procedures were completely satisfactory for local users but failed when an attempt was made to extend them to the remote user in either case this paper asserts that a problem exists and offers a set of suggestions for its amelioration existing information having used or attempted to use the information currently available i should first summarize the existing sources and indicate that they don t meet total needs there is the resource notebook index the index is an ordered list of attributes which refer one to the appropriate main entry for hosts exhibiting that attribute when the index is completed it will reference the main entries in the resource notebook to which we now turn out attention on the whole the main entry contains a summary of the hardware and software services available at this site these entries serve as a shopping list from which we may select the service center hosts which may be suitable for the computing we wish to undertake some administrative information is also provided using the outline of a host site subsection this information consists of i personnel v b rate structure v d long term storage vii login viii operator communication ix miscellaneous and x programs the discussion under ix miscellaneous included a statement of intention to include an elaborated documentation section in a future revision of the resource book this is most urgently required this paper abrams page rfc july contains a proposal which might constitute the outline for that section another source of information concerning serving hosts is the nic some sites have submitted existing documentation to the nic some have even written special documents to assist network users there are several problems however it may be difficult to learn about said documents especially for someone new to the arpanet and or the nic nic policy is to lend the documents which is fine for browsing but unacceptable for reference information required employing a questionnaire format i will now present additional outline entries which might be used to supplement nic xi administrative procedures relating to financial arrangements who does a prospective user contact is there a way to sample using the system gratis how does one open an account for computer services how does one obtain the necessary blank administrative forms can all expenses e g manuals postage be charged to the computer services account how does one determine the status of his account what is the relationship of a number of users to accounts how can one determine the charges accruing during a session how often are account statements issued how current are account statements when issued xii information dissemination a documentation is there a beginners pocket does it contain examples is there a list of documents available where abrams page rfc july where are published documents sold how does the remote user obtain these documents may document purchases be charged to the account how are errata sheets distributed how often are manuals updated how are updates announced what local documentation is available necessary what manufacturer hardware software documentation is available necessary is manufacturer documentation available from the same source as local documentation and with the same arrangements what is the mechanism for resolution of conflicts amongst manuals is documentation available for each subsystem and application program is there a printed newsletter or equivalent if so what is the procedure for becoming a subscriber for obtaining back issues is there a message of the day automatically presented how does an irregular user keep informed of past messages of the day is there an on line information service like a newspaper how does one obtain back issues of the newspaper b user assistance is there a required single point of contact for remote users what is his level of technical competence what is his level of administrative responsibility when the contact person cannot answer a question will he follow it up with the appropriate in house person will the remote user be referred to the in house person abrams page rfc july to what extent will a remote user be permitted or denied access to technical and administrative staff what priority does the local user have relative to the remote user is there a telephone service for answering questions is inwats or equivalent provided what are the service hours is there an on line assistance mechanism how does it work is there a mechanism for sending messages to an off line user consultant c technical capabilities and requirements is there an index of system capabilities communications how do you log in or whatever it is called what device assumptions are made concerning lines per page columns per line seperate line feed seperate carriage return combined carriage return line feed horizontal tab vertical tab form feed and back space have any of the non printing ascii characters been assigned non standard functions command language what is the minimum set of control statements required where are the control statements documented what are the installation defaults on control statements file system and editor s what are the attributes of the file system describe the naming conventions of the defaults how is a set subset and superset of files defined abrams page rfc july related and named what is the minimum information about the file system that is required in order to use the editor s and language processors are names divided into adjectival qualifiers what are these called are there restrictions defaults describe the editor s characteristics what documentation is available are there in line editing features e g erase immediately preceding character erase entire line describe languages what language processors are available how are the processors implemented e g batch compiler interpreter incremental computer what difference does it made to the user what is the compitability of your language dialect s with the standard and with other dialects to what extent can program units written in different languages communicate discuss data types representations and structures as well as subroutine linkage conventions xiii operations what measures are in effect to preserve the security of one s files and accounts can a remote user direct printing punched cards plotting etc to an on site device how does he get his output mailed to him what off line secondary storage is available how is it used what does it cost how does the remote user request renew release mount and demount tapes and disk packs what arrangements are there for mailing off line storage media abrams page rfc july is the operating staff aware that there are remote users are there services available to local users not available to remote users and conversely is there on line file storage what does it cost what limits are imposed how often is it backed up does the announced operating schedule consider users in different time zones is the announced schedule closely followed how are remote users notified of changes in the schedule implementation much of the information suggested herein as being beneficial for remote user would also apply to local users perhaps much of it already exists in local documentation i assert that the remote user is usually unable to easily find the information especially when he works with several remote hosts presenting the information in a format that followed a standard outline would certainly be a service i also recognize that preparation of this information might involve a duplication of effort and would possibly produce two documents which had to be updated when changes occurred one solution is to follow the outline in producing a guide to the literature available from the host site this rfc was put into machine readable form for entry into the online rfc archives by alan ford abrams page
