 network working group l p deutsch rfc parc maxc nic august nic ncp experiment for the past couple of weeks the nic ncp has been keeping statistics on total incoming messages incoming host host control opcodes and size of outgoing messages the results have been rather enlightening and i think should be carefully considered by future implementors of ncps for servers the statistics will be presented in a rather qualitative fashion since they were reset each time the system came up but they represent a total of about hours of uptime most of it during the working day the total numbers of incoming and outgoing messages were almost identical there were about more outgoing there were slightly over half as many incoming control opcodes processed as incoming messages on the assumption that no incoming control message had more than one opcode slightly over half the incoming messages were control messages the opcode statistics were somewhat variable in all cases the all opcode accounted for the great majority from a low of about on weekends to a high of on a busy weekday almost all of the remainder were nops no other opcode ever accounted for more than the output message statistics were taken as log message size this included word of buffer header word of imp header and l word of host header as might be expected of all outgoing messages had l to pdp words bit of data however if one multiplies the count for each bucket by the average message site for the bucket the result is that only of all outgoing data was in the smallest message size the remaining data was spread out fairly evenly between the other buckets i would draw the following conclusions from these statistics first half the messages on the network appear to be alls this suggests that ncps should give some thought to processing control messages efficiently second of the messages are very short this suggests that elaborate buffering and queuing schemes are not likely to be valuable since the hypothetical gain in efficient use of the imp is probably swamped by the overhead within the host third a sufficiently large fraction of all data is in large messages presumably file transfers that it is also necessary to deal with this situation efficiently e g a ncp which always sent l character messages would not be satisfactory deutsch page rfc nic ncp experiment august the arpanet has been in vigorous operation for a year or two and many ncps have been written during this time including a rewrite of the tenex ncp which probably handles more traffic than all other ncps combined to my knowledge no one has bothered to gather these statistics before the total time invested in putting these measurements into the nic system was about half an hour instructions i find it regrettable that even those of us presumably engaged in computer science have not found it necessary to confirm our hypotheses about network operation by experiment an to improve our theories on the basis of evidence this rfc was put into machine readable form for entry into the online rfc archives by alex mckenzie with support from gte formerly bbn corp deutsch page
