 network working group k victor request for comments september proposal for modifying linking we plan to modify the link jsys in tenex to work in a little bit better way in terms of the user interface conversations with bbn indicate that they have no complaints with the current implementation however if after we have gained experience with our new implementation we will let them know about it and they will review the new implementation and possibly accept it as part of standard tenex i would appreciate feedback in the next couple of days so that i can go ahead and implement this proposal or a modified proposal or nothing i estimate that it will only take a couple of hours to implement note that by modifying the jsys the proposed changes as specified will be in effect at the user level in the exec the default state for all users will remain as it currently is i e receive links now consider users a b and c if a and b link to each other they are now holding a conversation after establishing a conversation all members of the conversation will be placed in the refuse links state if user c or any other user now tries to link to user a or b the bell will ring on users a or b and c terminals indicating that a or b is in a refuse links state if a ignores the bell then c is not admitted to the conversation and a and b can continue their conversation as if c had never tried to enter the conversation however if a does a receive links while the bell is ringing the bell rings for approximately seconds then c will be linked into the conversation and not to just user a thus a and b will be linked a and c will be linked and b and c will be linked i e a three way conversation also users a b and c will be in the refuse links state victor page rfc proposal for modifying linking september whenever a user leaves a conversation his state will be set automatically to receive links thus when user c does a break links the resulting states will be a and b will be linked and both will be in refuse links c will be out of the conversation and will be in receive links now when a or b does a break links there will no longer be a conversation and both a and b will be in the receive links state to summarize after any conversation is established all members of the conversation are placed in the refused links state when a user links to a terminal or a user he is in fact linking into a conversation if one exists or to an individual if no conversation is taking place when a user leaves a conversation she is placed in the receive links state changes to the tlink jsys will be necessary to implement the above no changes are required in the exec in addition to the above changes we will add a new jsys that will return the link and advise status for a passed terminal i e you will be able to tell which lines are linked to the passed terminal which lines the passed terminal is linked to which line the passed terminal is advising and or which line is advising the passed terminal this information will probably be incorporated into the systat printout the where is printout and will probably be used within nls for shared screen work this rfc was put into machine readable form for entry into the online rfc archives by bob german victor page
