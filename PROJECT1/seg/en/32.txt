 network working group january rfc abhay bhushan mit nic categories d d and d updates rfc the use of set data type transaction in file transfer protocol as mentioned in rfc the opcode of is set aside for the clarify the use of set data type in file transfer operations in many systems such as multics at mit there is no provision to identify the type of data i e ascii or numeric stored in files the manner in which the data is handled is context dependent ascii characters are stored as four bit characters per bit word right justified with left most bit as zero as efficient conversion programs exists in multics for conversion of data from multics ascii into network ascii it would be useful for a user to be able to instruct the multics server to convert data into network ascii in retrieve operations it is suggested that the set data type transaction be used for this purpose the set data type transaction preceding a retrieve request should be interpreted by a server to mean that the user wants to receive his data in that form if the server is unable to convert the data into the desired form it should return a set data type of this rfc was put into machine readable form for entry into the online rfc archives by bbn corp under the direction of alex mckenzie page network working group january rfc abhay bhushan mit the following examples should clarify the use of set data type transactions user server set data type network ascii store file x file x in network ascii end of file acknowledge retrieve file x file x in network ascii end of file user server set data type ebcdic retrieve file y set data type bit stream file y as stored no conversion end of file set data type network ascii retrieve file z file z in network ascii end of file page
