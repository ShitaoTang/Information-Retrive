 ucsb computer network working group research lab request for comments roland f bryan nic february new console attachments to the ucsb host the mlc m the ucsb is equipped with an interface unit that allows attachment of any type of i o device to the multiplexor channel and for that device to be operated by program control as though it were a standard ibm control unit the interface referred to as the multi line controller m mlc m operates on the multiplexor channel and provides independently addressed i o connections that are grouped into pairs to accommodate full duplex i o operation each input group has a bit input buffer plus related synchronizing and control logic to make it a stand alone control unit on the channel similarly each output group has a bit buffer plus logic attachment is achieved by connection through a data set type connector and i o signal levels conform to eia standards rs spec both the i o group hardware and the supporting software for the mlc m are readily modified to produce any variations required for attachment and operation of non standard devices since our primary support was for b data sets at baud we first implemented the i o group pairs to accommodate this type of modem in our time shared user environment the i o groups have now been variously modified to support a wide range of applications from baud acoustic coupled use to baud for multi station classroom operation new consoles in addition to our standard attachments which are mostly culler fried graphic display consoles and educational classrooms page using such consoles we have a tektronix a and an nih general purpose graphics terminal gpgt the tektronix terminal can now be operated on the arpanet and will provide our users with upper and lower case ascii for easier operation with other sites a report on this console s capability will be forthcoming the gpgt was developed by the university of iowa for use in bio medical applications the unit is a delay line refreshed video display with graphic capability and is the only dynamic type display in use on our host computer at present we are evaluating its performance in our on line system environment since a user at this terminal is also able to reach into the network we will have some future comments on its operation for interested persons this rfc was put into machine readable form for entry into the online rfc archives by bbn corp under the direction of alex mckenzie page
