 network working group j winett request for comments jmw nic february telnet command at host ll the attached writeup documents the use of the telnet command at host ll for uses under the cp cms time sharing system this command provides for use in a half duplex or full duplex mode and can be used with ascii codes or with ebcdic codes i e transparent mode the keyboard conventions allow for entering all ascii codes using a control character followed by another character for the codes not present on an ibm terminal in addition a number of local telnet control commands have been defined which allows the mode of operation to be changed the redefinition of special characters the sending of telnet control codes as well as for obtaining input from a file instead of from the terminal these later features provide for a rudimentary file transfer facility this material has not been reviewed for public release and is intended only for use with the arpa network it should not be quoted or cited in any publication not related to the arpa network telnet purpose to access another terminal oriented system on the arpa network format telnet host resume ebcdic halfdup open ascii fulldup host either the hexadecimal code for a foreign network service site or a standard mnemonic for a foreign site see figure tag the identifier for the local connections to the network the tag is used together with the address of the virtual machine descriptor table utable to form local socket numbers which are used in the network protocol resume used to reactivate communications with a foreign site after having previously left the telnet command leaving the connections open winett page rfc telnet command at host ll february ebcdic to communicate with ebcdic codes the default is network ascii halfdup to operate under a half duplex protocol i e with a locked keyboard the ebcdic halfdup the protocol assumes that the telnet break code circle c will be received to indicate when the keyboard should be locked for input in ascii halfdup the keyboard will lock after a line of input and will unlock after one or more lines have been received for output an external interrupt will also unlock a locked keyboard the default is full duplex where the keyboard is always unlocked for input a null line is required to temporarily lock the keyboard in order to receive output usage a number of hosts on the arpa network provide telnet service a network virtual terminal nvt has been specified so that using sites can write one telnet program which maps a local terminal into the nvt to access any serving site on the network once communication has been established between a using site and a serving site keyed input is sent to the serving system and output from the serving site when received is typed on the local terminal the nvt protocol requires that the keyboard be capable of entering all of the ascii codes together with a number of the telnet control codes to support an nvt with an ibm terminal it is necessary to adapt a control convention for entering codes which are not associated with single keys on the keyboard in addition since cp cms processes input from a on a line at a time terminated with a newline a means must be establish for entering a sequence of characters for transmission which is not terminated with a newline code when telnet is initiated the message enter control character is typed a non blank character should then be entered which defines the character which in combination with another character will be used to enter codes not associated with single winett page rfc telnet command at host ll february keys the control character is also used for other special control functions as described below codes the nvt usually requires that characters be transmitted in an eight bit ascii code since the telnet command is written to process ebcdic codes ascii codes received are translated into ascii before being sent to a serving site figure gives the complete definition of ebcdic indicating the ebcdic controls and ebcdic graphics figure gives the codes for the ascii controls and graphics the complete mapping between bit ebcdic codes and bit

suppress and the telnet control noecho is mapped into the ebcdic code for restore print restore if the telnet control for echo is received a message is printed and it is mapped into an idle similarly if the telnet control for break is received a message is printed and it is mapped into an idle unless operation is in ebcdic halfdup mode in which case the break is used to indicate that any received characters should be printed and the keyboard unlocked for input if a data mark or an interrupt is received no action is taken except to print a message to notify the user of this occurrence winett

control character the following keyboard characters do not have a different meaning when preceded by the control character cent sign space backspace tab when a character is mapped into its control code the control character is mapped into the code for idle if the control character is entered as the last character before the newline key is entered the sequence of characters entered is transmitted without the newline code that is the newline code is not transmitted when it is preceded by the control character when the keyboard is unlocked for input characters received cannot be typed until the keyboard is locked again after a line is entered received characters can then be typed when operating in full duplex or ascii half duplex a null line entered will allow received characters to be typed but will not cause the new line code to be transmitted to cause a null line i e just the new line code to be transmitted the control character should be entered as the only character in the input line in ebcdic halfdup a null line entered will cause a null line to be transmitted output ascii output received from the nvt is converted into ebcdic with the sequences cr lf converted into idle nl the ebcdic characters are then sent to the terminal note that not all ascii codes when converted to ebcdic will print on a of the ascii graphics and the ascii controls which are
