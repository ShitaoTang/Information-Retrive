 network working group marc seriff request for comments mit dmcg nic march references rfc arpanet host availability data several months ago a survey program was implemented on the mit dmcg its pdp system to aid in gathering information on the availability of various hosts on the arpanet the purpose of this request for comments is threefold to inform the network working group of the existence of this information gathering service and about getting access to it to present the results of survey for its first few months and to correct errors in our data or collection methods briefly the survey program works as follows at minute intervals whenever the mit dmcg its time sharing system is in normal operation a survey is started the survey program attempts to establish a connection to the logger socket of each host listed in its table the results of each connection attempt are recorded for future reference the initial connection protocol is aborted prior to reading the transmitted socket number so as to cause the minimum amount of processing at surveyed hosts if the logger connection succeeds the average request for connection response time in seconds for the host is updated this information can later be viewed in several formats using the mit dmcg server telnet netwrk as described below each test results in the assignment of one of the following five statuses logger available connection completed logger not responding rfc sent host host ok but no response seconds allowed logger rejecting close returned by ncp ncp not responding reset timed out seconds allowed host dead host dead status returned by imp page below you will find a summary of the information gathered to date it must be remembered that the survey program can only run when mit dmcg its time sharing system is in normal operation and the mit imp is operational thus the current figure of for mit dmcg is inaccurate it should actually be closer to there are in addition two other shortcomings of which we are aware the first is that survey is on a hour basis and does not consider advertised up time for example mit dmcg will never be better than on a tuesday since the machine is always unavailable from p m to midnight the second shortcoming is the fact that the lincoln lab s tx shows as never available this reflects an as yet undiagnosed problem currently under investigation to get availability information from dmcg you must first follow the scenario in rfc once in netwrk the dmcg user telnet there are seven available commands which pertain to survey data summary of surveys summarizes most recent information history of gives a detailed recent history of the given host this generates a lot of output so use it sparingly active hosts lists those hosts who accepted a connection at least once during the last hours best survey lists the best of the recent surveys longterm summary of surveys summarizes all past information this was used to generate the table on the next page longterm history of gives a summary of past history of the given host it does not generate as much output as the history command longterm active hosts lists those hosts who accepted a connection at least once since december page for the above seven commands recent is define as within the last hours or less for help in accessing survey data and comments on improving the admittedly limited survey service please contact marc seriff m i t project mac main street cambridge mass ext page surveys from on to on host up resp ucla nmc sri arc ucsb utah bbn ncc multics rand rcc sdcadept harv ll su sail ill case cmu burr ames radc nbs tink usc ncar ucla ccn sri ai tenex mit dmcg rand csg harv ll tx ill burrtest tenexb mit ai harv remember that up is defined as logger accepting connections surveyed only since february mit dmcg is actually up about of the time this rfc was put into machine readable form for entry into the online rfc archives by bbn corp under the direction of alex mckenzie page
