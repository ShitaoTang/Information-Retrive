 network working group anonymous request for comments center for advanced computation u of ill nic july minutes of network graphics group meeting sunday evening july the meeting came to order around jim michener presiding after introductions an agenda was constructed for the rest of the meeting elaine thomas distributed copies of an alternative network graphics protocol for attendees to read overnight prior to discussion because some individuals were absent who had definitely indicated that they were coming monday morning the meeting was adjourned at after deciding to meet at the next morning monday morning afternoon july the meeting was called to order at jim michener distributed an outline of a paper describing desirable facilities for the use of two dimensional input devices with a hierarchically structured display program ken victor distributed copies of rfc a proposed network text graphics protocol ljournal ken pogran described the history of the ngg and how the levels approach of rfc came about in particular the level protocol was an attempt to define something to experiment with but with the thought that it should be possible to imbed level meaningfully in any later protocol reports of network graphics experiences jon jervert described the installation at cad cam fort monmouth they have a spectrum of display terminals and have tried several via a telnet connection to mit dmcg they experienced unacceptable slowness with a baud bandwidth austin henderson described an air traffic control experiment in which the simulator receives codes describing changes in state and generates descriptions of the air space region being controlled page rfc minutes of network graphics july and aircraft position and velocity these descriptions are highly encoded they are not pictures in any general sense the rate at which the simulation proceeded was adequate jim michener described the results of an experiment in which the e s lds at mit dmcg was used to generate stylus inking input for a character recognition program at sdc the experiment was plagued with difficulties including bugs in sdc s ncp and scheduling of experimental debugging sessions when the experiment was finally terminated due to planned extensive hardware modifications at dmcg a clear understanding had not yet emerged but apparently network transmission delays had been experienced of up to seconds dan cohen described an aircraft flight simulator which interacts with a user at the harvard pdp the simulation takes place on a pdp network traffic is approximately bits from the pdp to the pdp and several thousand bits in the opposite direction it has been found that at least updates are required per second to give the pilot an adequate feeling of control the harvard pdp and one at bbn have been used the latter at am to avoid loading problems john pickens described ucsb s status regarding output in level network graphics protocol ngp steve bunch reported that he has an imlac monitor which accepts ngp directly programs have been developed at ccn using subroutine packages modeled after plotter packages which build files containing pictures in ngp other programs output the pictures either to a gould plotter or a storage display in device specific code or to an imlac in ngp form steve holmgren briefly described a fancy arpa network graphics system fangs under development at ucsd discussion of modifications in the graphics protocol david egli reported that he and jim foley of univ of north carolina thought that the graphics protocol should have the ability to replace items and that dimensional data should be allowable jim foley also thinks that a subpicture call should be able to specify a rate of rotation scaling and translation in addition to initial values for these an extended coffee break followed to allow perusal of the documents distributed page rfc minutes of network graphics july elaine thomas summarized her protocol proposal for a hierarchically structured editable display file discussion related to the levels approach of rfc concluded that levels were inappropriate we would henceforth think in terms of negotiable options ken victor stressed that nls was particularly desirous of being able to make use of the graphics protocol that was the reason for their developing rfc ken pogran observed that a structures display system as is being proposed is more a distributed graphics system than a protocol and that he thought this a good idea general consensus agreed with him jim michener described proposals for input he emphasized the necessity of transmitting position information in figure coordinates as opposed to screen coordinates or top level figure coordinates bob sproul described two different ways in which a graphics application in a serving host can communicate to a using host controlling a display device if the using host has complex enough software or hardware a structured definition of the display may be sent a structured display definition consists of figures also called pictures or groups which consist of units a unit is either a call to another figure or a collection of one or more text or graphic commands other special purpose units may exist also figures and units have names and may be created replaced and deleted and other things a simpler scheme for the using host is that transformed segmented display information be sent across the network segments have names and can be individually created replaced and deleted either the application works directly in terms of segments or it works in terms of a structures display definition and software at the serving host has the responsibility of evaluating the transformations and the sub figure calls page rfc minutes of network graphics july it seems likely that such transformation software might have to exist at the serving host anyway if that host has any graphics terminals of small to moderate capability it was agreed to restrict our attention to the simpler transformed segmented scheme and delay consideration of the hierarchically structured scheme until another meeting it seemed to the meeting that a significant number of applications would need nothing more powerful than a segmented scheme one desirable mechanism is an end batch of updates command it can help optimize the use of a storage terminal and it can let a user program causes fixes to occur on a refresh tube all at once after lunch ira cotton pointed out that it would be easy enough to allow ngp to be upward compatible with a segmented transformed scheme bob sproul agreed and said that that was a good argument for sending only device independent data on the net this idea was modified in discussion on tuesday ken victor discussed tty units a mechanism for displaying characters which are unescorted i e are not part of a graphics text command in particular they are for spontaneous messages from the operating system like out of funds or going down in min general discussion was undecided on whether tty units should really be part of a graphics protocol this was later decided affirmatively it was noted that unescorted characters coming from the serving host could probably be handled but that those coming from the using host might not be discussion of network connection for graphics a graphics connection may start out with a telnet connection we will request a do graphics telnet option multiplexing on the telnet connection vs using a separate connection pair dan cohen stated that his flight simulator uses a second pair alex mckenzie pointed out that some hosts have only read and block input commands not read and continue this means we cannot demand to have separate connection pairs with graphics on one and telnet type information on the other page rfc minutes of network graphics july jim hansen called for a show of hands of preferences nls was the only site against using multiple connection several sites were against multiplexing graphics information on the telnet connection issues included it is easier to merge two streams at the user than to split one into two the latter requires smart programming tip users may lose if multiple connections are required it should be possible to do it on one connection in summary two connections are better than one the number shall be negotiated over the telnet connection ira cotton asked for a discussion of connection initiation other than via a telnet connection it was agreed that we did not know enough at this time to specify this and that it was a matter for experimentation someone commented that what we have is a network virtual graphics terminal which has a network virtual keyboard and a network virtual printer in the telnet sense and a network virtual display unit the printer and the display unit may be the same ira cotton announced that jim foley of univ of north carolina is planning to have a workshop on machine independent graphics under the auspices of siggraph in washington d c around mid april cherry blossom time discussion of graphics input dan cohen summarized the use of input in his flight simulator since it comprises only approximately bits in toto all switches knobs and stylus position are transmitted this takes place about five times per second austin henderson described the input facilities on the ll tx attentions are enabled what information will be desired when a particular attention occurs is described at the time the attention is enabled when an attention occurs the system records the desired information in a queue for the application program when the application program is next scheduled it examines the queue and responds as it sees fit page rfc minutes of network graphics july it was generally agreed to adopt the tx strategy input devices will not be enabled unless the server does so no restriction is placed on any lies the using host wishes to make regarding disguising one device as another network connections for input follow the same rules as for output what input attentions are implemented at the using host may be determined by the serving host in response to an inquiry inking will be provided by the using host but only one inking input can be specified at a time no buffering ahead shall be done by the using host tracking means the feedback of the current two dimensional input device position to the user this is automatically turned on by inking positioning and targeting hitting attentions what data are reported at the time of an attention is specified by the application at the server when the attention is enabled types of attentions were listed and also what additional optional information could be specified with each deactivating inputs was discussed it is possible for the application to explicitly deactivate an attention when an attention is enabled it shall be possible to specify when it should be deactivated three modes were mentioned never turned off until the application explicitly does so turned off when it occurs self destruct turned off when any attention occurs the need for a synchronization message was agreed upon it was agreed that the serving host using host relationship would be one of master slave among other things the using host would never volunteer input information which the serving host application had not asked for it was decided to meet the next morning at the meeting adjourned about page rfc minutes of network graphics july monday evening july about seven of us met in ken victor s room bob sproul led the meeting and kept track of the various aspects of the protocol protocol topics which had been discussed during the day s meeting were covered again most aspects were firmed up based on the day s discussions several topics were identified for discussion in the morning operations on and attributes of segments were defined the server should be able to enquire for various information from the using host whether the using host has all the features implemented which the application needs what input devices the human has at his disposal what sort of terminal is being used not so as to send device specific code to it but so that the application does not try to use some graphics programming technique on a terminal which can not handle it e g some sort of dynamics on a storage tube the server may request that the using host report what segments have been defined their status and what is contained in then this is good for debugging and also provides a limited facility of building a picture then dumping it to some storage medium other than a graphics device it was pointed out that the effect of multiple changes in the display replacing inserting and deleting segments should occur all at once when an end batch of updates command is received by the using host for a refreshed display this means keeping old and new copies of segments until the batch command is received this rule may be waived if storage limitations dictate page rfc minutes of network graphics july there was considerable discussion on input it was felt to be the least firm of any aspects of the protocol the meeting broke up around tuesday morning afternoon july bob sproul presented the results of the previous evening s discussion to the whole meeting the features required of a graphics user program under the proposed protocol were divided into three classes required features included segment manipulation primitive graphics output operations and response to queries from the server regarding what is implemented at the using host what input devices the human has available etc optional features included tty units reporting the contents of a segment back to the server at his request experimental features included input it was assumed that after some experience experimental features would become either required or optional a full list of required optional and experimental features will be issued as a supplement to the description of the protocol a graphics server program need only implement those features which applications at that site make use of there was some discussion regarding how and when the graphics protocol should be published the protocol is still regarded as experimental and we wouldn t want any site to assume otherwise to their later dismay some worry was expressed about finally presenting this protocol to the network community in a form that would not frighten too many people ira cotton advised us to include a glossary bob sproul will put an initial version skeleton of a description of the graphics protocol for transformed segmented scheme into nls and will invite everybody in the group to edit it in normal nls fashion page rfc minutes of network graphics july when one does editing normally one s ident the date and the time are associated with each statement one touches this information can be seen via the viewspec capital k there was some discussion of whether level ngp could be imbedded in the transformed segmented graphics protocol one unfortunate part of ngp was that an end picture the is not explicitly required in order to see something if it were required then it could act like an end batch of updates command ucsb assumes that ngp works like a storage tube they append a new function plot to an existing picture never having sent an end picture operation this ability to append in a storage tube fashion struck the processors of refresh tubes as quite a drawback because of implementation difficulties it was decided to allow a using site to have ngp compatibility but not to require it at least the ngp opcodes would not be reused except for the end picture problem and possibly also a coordinate system problem coordsys ngp can be imbedded in the transformed segmented protocol with the entire ngp picture corresponding to a single segment the following sites hope to achieve implementations of the experimental segmented protocol ucsb hopes to have a server running for ols and signal analysis speech processing sri arc hopes to have nls operate in this protocol mit dmcg may have some simple serving programs several people plan to implement user programs at least as far as the required features go coordsys a discussion arose concerning what coordinate system should be used in sending graphics output primitives from the server to the user the following problems were addressed page rfc minutes of network graphics july what happens if the display segment terminal screen area to be used by the application is not rectangular what happens if the basic unit delta x is not the same as the unit delta y the application might want a degree line to really be at degrees various answers to the first question use the largest square within the rectangle centered adjusted to the left top right or bottom use the smallest square surrounding the rectangle how is the rectangle positioned in the square ngp standard coordinates to used and mapped into the whole rectangle the user reports left bottom right and top physical coordinates and the server sends coordinates within the range given this is compatible with the attitude that the transformed segmented graphics data are sent it is also saves the using host which might be an imlac from doing a multiply john pickens observed that if a graphics server for a finicky application transmits characters as strokes then the application is assured of having the characters positioned in exactly the right place e g for a numeric label on a tic mark on the axis of a graph if characters are sent as text not strokes positioning is not necessarily guaranteed ken victor and jim michener will look into ways of keeping the ngg apprised of progress in terms of what sites have experimental operational graphics protocol servers or user programs using a pointer file in the nic the next ngg meeting is tentatively scheduled for the first sunday in february at pm it will either be at the nic or partly there and partly at xerox parc the meeting was adjourned at page rfc minutes of network graphics july appendix meeting participants affiliation online mailing address
