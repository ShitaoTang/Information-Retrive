 network working group p karp request for comments xxxx mitre nic february categorization and guide to nwg rfcs the nwg rfc guide is an attempt to introduce some order into the nwg rfc series which now numbers the guide categorizes the nwg rfc notes identifies topics under discussion and the relevant nwg rfcs and indicates whether the notes are current obsolete or superseded a minimum subset of nwg rfcs is identified this subset consists of the nwg rfcs that one should read to quickly become familiar with the current status of topics for historical reasons and for readers interested in tracing through the stages of development of a topic a brief summary is given for each nwg rfc relevant to a particular category this initial guide is being issued as a nwg rfc since it establishes the basis for future releases so please comment suggestions criticism corrections etc will be accepted for a period of approximately two weeks be critical as i have not had to implement an ncp and probably have some misconceptions regarding various technical points an official version will be released on march the guide will then be a unique series of documents separate from nwg rfcs as is the document no no series with regard to renumbering nwg rfcs i am inclined to keep she sequential numbering scheme presently employed the main reason for this position is that the current numbers have both historical and semantic significance for example reference to etc is a convenient shorthand reminiscent of the old corny joke about joke s used extensively during meetings the list of current status nwg rfc numbers should dispel any fear of maintaining stacks of nwg rfcs for quick reference the subject is not closed however and i will entertain any objections suggestions etc guide to network working group request for comments the nwg rfc notes are partitioned into categories which in turn are divided into subcategories for each category the official document if any unresolved issues and documents to be published are identified karp page rfc categorization guide to nwg rfc s february for each subcategory relevant nwg rfcs are listed and a brief description of the topics addressed in each note is given the categories are again listed and the current nwg rfcs identified p the nwg rfcs in the list comprise the subset defining current status note that most of the documentation in the subset addresses topics in category d subsystem level protocol where at the present time most issues are unresolved finally the nwg rfcs are listed by number with a reference to the relevant categories p a administrative a distribution list nwg rfc s the distribution list contains names addresses and phone numbers for recipients of nwg rfcs the most recent list nwg rfc designates the technical liaison as the recipient for each site and supersedes all other rfcs in this category a meeting announcements nwg rfc s general network working group meetings are held approximately every three months special subcommittee meetings are held on an ad hoc basis all related nwg rfcs are obsolete except announcing a graphics meeting to be held at mit in april and announcing a general nwg meeting atlantic city may a meeting minutes nwg rfc s the meeting minutes present highlights of issues discussed at general nwg meetings and report definite decisions that are made to be published a nwg rfc will be published by dick watson sri reporting on the nwg meeting held at the university of illinois february karp page rfc categorization guide to nwg rfc s february a guide to nwg rfcs nwg rfc s the nwg rfc guide categorizes the nwg rfc notes identifies topics under discussion the relevant nwg rfcs and denotes whether the notes are current obsolete or superseded included in this category are lists of nwg rfcs ordered by number as in and or by author a policies nwg rfc s nwg rfcs categorized as policy contain official stands on issues i e the position taken by s crocker nwg chairman the issues covered are varied in particular and discuss meeting policy and discuss the decision to delay making changes to the host host protocol in order to first gain experience with the network a committee to propose specific changes has been formed discusses changes to the host host protocol and the schedule for introducing modifications sets forth the mechanism for establishing and modifying the official host host protocol presents the initial official protocol presents some suggestions for policy on some outstanding issues requests the tagging of imp imp teletype messages documentation conventions for nwg rfcs are given in and and designate uses for particular link numbers has been superseded by and is obsolete discusses the issuing of document in lieu of the official modification procedure outlined in karp page rfc categorization guide to nwg rfc s february b host imp protocol level official document bbn memo no latest revision february unresolved issues location of first byte of data in a message to be published document no will be written by s crocker and will among other things resolve the first byte location issue b general topics nwg rfc s a in particular raised several questions regarding host imp protocol in a bbn responds to the questions proposes that the hosts control the ordering of imp host traffic rather than getting messages delivered in the order received by the imp this proposal is counter to bbn s position specifically expressed in that is buffering is a host rather than an imp function the purpose of buffering in the imp is to handle surges of traffic thus imp buffers should be empty nwg rfc is obsolete discusses changes to bbn memo no the remarks are obsolete contains a general description of the interface between a host and the imp nwg rfc comments on nwg rfc the use of rfnms type and type messages to control flow is discussed in nwg rfcs and the official position in cease on link i e discontinue the mechanism is presented in and renders obsolete the remarks in and discusses the changes to message format that would be necessary if multiplexing connections over links was allowed karp page rfc categorization guide to nwg rfc s february b marking padding nwg rfc s in particular presents the decision of the host host protocol committee to abandon the marking convention and to ignore padding the issue of whether to have the first data byte begin after bits of header or to use double physical transmission nwg rfc s is discussed the former official position is expressed in all regular messages consist of a bit leader marking text and padding marking is a possibly null sequence of zeros followed by a padding is a followed by a possibly null sequence of zeros several proposals to eliminate marking have been made suggests a hardware modification to eliminate marking padding by adding appropriate counters to host imp interfaces suggests breaking regular messages into two messages supports and suggest that such changes be postponed until sufficient experience with the network is gained introduces the notion of double padding and presents two alternative approaches when a message does not end on a host word boundary a the host provides padding in addition to the imps double padding b the host shifts messages to end on a word boundary explains double padding in more detail and discusses the pros and cons a suggestion is made to use marking to adjust the word baundary alternative b nwg rfcs and are concurrences with presents a method to handle the stripping of padding from a message all nwg rfcs in this category have been superseded by c host host protocol level host host protocol specifies the procedures by which connections for inter host interprocess communication over the network are established maintained and terminated the software which implements the protocol within each host is called the network karp page rfc categorization guide to nwg rfc s february control program ncp the topics included in this category are connection establishment and termination flow control interrupt handling error control and status testing dynamic reconnection and the relationship between connections and links official documents document no by s crocker august with modifications presented in nwg rfc unresolved issues length of control messages location in message of first byte of data flow control algorithm socket identification format to be published document no will be written by s crocker and will resolve the first three issues a nwg rfc will be written by j heafner in collaboration with e meyer and g grossman presenting the pros and cons on alternative proposals for socket number identification c host host protocol proposals nwg rfc s the official host host protocol presented in document no is based on the proposals discussions acceptance and rejection of ideas in the above list of nwg rfcs up to and including in particular and represent an early attempt at a host host protocol supersedes and contains some modifications to control message formats presented in the protocol was not considered powerful enough because it didn t provide for inter host communication without logging in this protocol was thrown out as a result of a network meeting in december is the basis for the current protocol it was presented at the sjcc is a modification of it discusses connection establishment without switching flow control and introduces the idea of reconnection control commands are summarized was distributed at a network meeting in march karp page rfc categorization guide to nwg rfc s february presents the reaction to and presents ideas on reconnection flow control and decoupling of links and connections provisions of error detection status testing experimentation and expansions are discussed and are comments written in response to the meeting is also a comment but in the form of a rewrite of introduces the notion of interrupts int and eco for status testing concerns the philosophy behind the notion of a link summarizes the issues discussed in the above nwg rfcs is the initial official protocol submitted for criticism comments etc it introduces a new mechanism for flow control in which the receiving host allocates buffer space and notifies the sending host of the space available and comment on document no differs from nwg rfc as follows commands gvb and ret have been added for flow control and error condition codes have been added to err nwg rfc presents some modifications to document no fixed lengths are specified for eco erp and err a new pair of commands rst and rrp suggested in are added and propose new host host protocols quite different from the current official protocol supersedes and are worth considering for possible implementation in future protocols hopefully more documents of a similar nature will be generated as experience is gained with the current protocol nwg rfcs and comment on document no points out an ambiguity in document no regarding the requirement of a message data type in the message sent from server socket the ambiguity is resolved by which eliminates message data type from level protocol c ncps description structure techniques nwg rfc s this category includes rfcs which give details of system calls table structures implementation techniques etc karp page rfc categorization guide to nwg rfc s february in particular nwg rfcs and are obsolete is a general statement on sending or receiving multiple control messages in a single communication discusses the system calls used for interaction between the ncp and a user process describes a possible implementation giving table structures and their interrelationships lists the system calls that sdc feels should operate includes spec of calls to ncp nwg rfc presents postel s and crocker s view on the environment in which a host time sharing system operates suggests some system calls and presents a design to illustrate the components of an ncp presents a prototypical ncp which implements the initial official protocol specified in it is offered as an illustrative example gives some techniques for stripping the padding from a message presents the method employed by the ccn host at ucla to resynchronize flow control when an input error occurs documents the implementation of sections of the ncp at ucsb gives a brief description of the interim interim ncp iincp on the mit dynamic modeling pdp used to run some experiments c connection establishment and termination nwg rfc s the nwg rfcs in this category present the system calls and control commands used to establish and terminate connections i e the handshaking that must transpire before connections are established or terminated in particular presents a rough scenario of connection establishment which differs from that specified in in that establishment does not include procedures for switching procedures karp page rfc categorization guide to nwg rfc s february suggests the addition of a command ter to supplement cls discusses the use of the cls command and suggests that two commands bls and cls be adopted and all discuss queuing of rfcs presents the initial official method for establishing and terminating connections and present schemes different from the official protocol c flow control nwg rfc s the nwg rfcs in this category address the problem of controlling the flow of messages from the sending socket to the receive socket the official position is stated in document no with an unresolved issue pending as described in nwg rfc in particular suggests that hosts may want the capability of agreeing to lock programs into core for more efficient core to core transfers this may require different handling of rfnms describes the use of rfnm type rather than on a link to control flow a control command rsm resume is defined to allow the host to signal for resumption of message flow describes the same technique describes the effect some proposed changes for reconnect and decoupling of connections and links would have on rfnms and cease on link mit s rewrite of protocol introduces blk and rsm commands as an alternative to cease on link spd and rsm commands presents bbn s position that buffering be handled by the host not the imp introduces a new flow control mechanism in which the receiving host is required to allocate buffer space for each connection and not notify the sending host of bit sizes a new command all to allocate space is sent from the receiving host to the sending host with this new mechanism and become obsolete karp page rfc categorization guide to nwg rfc s february presents the objections of project mac and lincoln labs to the flow control mechanism introduced in their preference is for cease on link which allocates buffer space on demand which defines a simplified ncp protocol presents a method of flow control based on the requirement that connections are full duplex comments on document no with respect to flow control it disagrees with the allocation mechanism and the introduction of irregular message to make the cease mechanism work proposes modifications to rfnm by defining three forms which would insure control of data and would replace the memory allocation mechanism eliminates the cease mechanism and introduces potential modifications to the flow control mechanism the latter will be resolved and presented in document no c error control and status testing nwg rfc s this category addresses schemes for detecting and controlling errors and for host status reporting and testing in particular talks about error checking and gives an algorithm for implementing a checksum it also recommends that hosts should have a mode in which positive verification of all messages is required brings up the topics of error detection and status testing which are expanded by rand in and introduces control commands err for error checking and qry hcu and hgd for status testing expands on the discussion suggests error codes introduces rpy as a response to qry and suggests that nop could be used for reporting host status concurs with on err and introduces eco to test communication between ncps recommends that err as presented in and be adopted that a distinction be made between resource errors and other error types that eco presented in be of variable length and that an eco erp command pair be adopted karp page rfc categorization guide to nwg rfc s february officially specifies the control commands err eco and erp the official protocol doesn t include a specific list of error types nor does it recommend the action to be taken suggestions for extensions to error detection and recovery and host host status testing are encouraged presents a list of error types and suggests new commands ovf for overflow errors and rst rsr for host status testing sets fixed lengths for err eco and erp control commands rst and rsr are adopted c interrupt nwg rfc s the interrupt system call and the int control commands are used to interrupt a process this is actually a third level issue the nwg rfcs leading up to the decision to include inr and ins in the official protocol are summarized below in particular introduces the int command as a method for interrupting a process recommends adoption of int with the restriction that the feature should not be used during communication with systems which scan for interrupts and that int should not be used on non console type connections see d expands on the explanation of int concurs with proposal that int is useful induces int ins control commands in the official protocol as an escape mechanism where interpretation is a local matter discusses synchronization of interrupt signals presents two implementation schemes and relegates the topic to third level protocol ins should be used to indicate a special code in the input stream c dynamic reconnection nwg rfc s the notion of dynamic reconnection was introduced early in the host host protocol design however the consensus was that it introduced complexities with which the initial ncp implementations karp page rfc categorization guide to nwg rfc s february did not want to cope the need for dynamic reconnection was questioned nwg rfc explains why it was included and considered useful in particular introduces the concept of switching connections to the logger presents a scheme for dynamic reconnection i e reconnection can take place after the flow is started presents two methods suggested by bbn for handling reconnection discusses changes to proposed end and rdy control commands that would be necessary if connections were multiplexed over links states that dynamic reconnection is too complex presents two cases where reconnection could be used suggests that the cases be separated and recommends implementation of only the case of a simple connection switch within the same host recommends that dynamic reconnection be reserved for further host host protocol implementations discusses the aesthetics of dynamic reconnection in detail but concedes that it won t be included in the initial protocol and concur with the decision c relation between connections and links nwg rfc s a connection is an extension of a link the nwg rfcs in this category discuss this relationship in particular presents the pros and cons on decoupling connections and links recommends that connections be multiplexed over links two cases where this would be useful are presented the effect on the proposed protocol is discussed both and suggest the inclusion of the destination socket as part of the text of the message and recommend that messages should be send over any unblocked link suggests the use of link numbers in control commands except rfss due to the to correspondence between links and foreign socket numbers karp page rfc categorization guide to nwg rfc s february recommends leaving links and connections coupled c other other topics that fall into the category of host host protocol are marking padding see b record message boundaries see d experimentation and expansion the assignment of links for experimentation and expansion is discussed in nwg rfc s and instance tag the addition of an instance tag to the socket identifier is introduced in is supported by and and is not recommended in the matter is unresolved see to be published section c broadcast facility a control command to implement a broadcast facility as introduced in it was not supported in d subsystem level protocol level official document none unresolved issues all to be published three committees have been set up to address user level issues specifically logger console and telnet protocols d d d data transformation d and graphics protocol d status reports will be published prior to the next network meeting may in addition a companion paper to discussing console protocol has been promised by mit mac and g grossman ill will issue an rfc proposing a file transmission protocol d logger protocol nwg rfc s logger protocol specifies the procedures by which a user gets connected to a remote host the logger is a process always in execution which listens for login requests karp page rfc categorization guide to nwg rfc s february in particular proposes that the logger listen to calls on socket it then switches to the assigned socket the sequence of events is illustrated proposes a user control and communication ucc module which implements logger protocol and permits the logger to interact with the ncp it proposes the use of two full duplex pseudo typewriter connections proposes that sockets and designate either the input and output sockets of a copy of the logger or the console sockets is a write up of a combination of the proposals presented in and presents the disadvantages of the new proposal and reverts back to supporting the ucc of indicates rand support for the ucc presented in defines a send logger and a receive logger with a full duplex connection the logger handles one request at a time requests are queued the receiver logger is identified as user on socket introduces a dial up protocol initial connection protocol icp to get a process at one site in contact with the logger at another site documents the logger implemented at ucsb and report the discussion of logger protocol at the fjcc network meeting e harslem and e meyer agreed to write proposals discusses a conflict between document no and nwg rfc regarding the use of all prior to connection establishment presents a variation of that rectifies the conflict also suggests that icp should apply to more than just the logger i e let user signify the logger documents the logger implemented as part of netrjs which allows access to rjs at ucla s ccn the icp described in and is adhered to the logger is designated as user contains a description of the logger for the pdp at harvard karp page rfc categorization guide to nwg rfc s february points out an ambiguity in the host host protocol of document no regarding the requirement of message data type for icp the ambiguity is rectified by ng rfc includes the icp as proposed in used to establish connection to nic is the logger protocol proposal issued by e meyer d console protocol nwg rfc s console protocol will specify conventions for what goes out over the network included are conventions for echoing character set interrupt or break end of line message formats in particular suggests a standard of bit ascii in an bit byte with the high order bit discusses three possibilities for echoing over the network echoing no echoing optional echoing and states a preference for no echoing also states a preference for establishing a network common code where all code conversion is performed on outgoing text thus all incoming text would be in the common code proposes the use of interrupt on the third level an interrupt means quit when sent from a requestor process to a created process the command level is entered and relegate issues of echoing and code conversion to third level protocol and support adoption of ascii for the network standard character set also discusses two uses of break characters interrupt in a panic situation and to exit from subsystem three message formats character by character end by carriage return several command lines per message are discussed a recommendation that echoing be handled locally is made specifies that the standard console use bit ascii in bits with the th bit on note the conflict with it also specifies the use of inr for break or interrupt documents console protocol implemented by ucsb karp page rfc categorization guide to nwg rfc s february and report on console protocol topics echoing full vs half duplex discussed at the network meeting fjcc documents conventions used by netrjs for rjs at ccn ucla discusses code standards and document conventions used for nic at sri arc proposes specifications for general console communications and addresses full vs half duplex character escapes and action characters d telnet protocol nwg rfc s telnet is a subsystem permitting a teletype like terminal at a remote host for function as a teletype at the serving host telnet protocol specifies user level interface to the network by way of network system calls in particular introduces the telnet concept and presents a sample dialogue between utah s pdp and sri s system primitives are proposed describes telnet and gives essentially the same example as in describes a terminal user control language for illinois s pdp arpa network terminal system the protocol defined permits the user to utilize the network at a symbolic level and introduce the concept of a protocol manager that can manage protocol sequences between consoles and the network the form machine see d can be used for translations contains a proposal for a user user protocol that has the ability to function as telnet describes a series of experiments to be conducted using the telnet subsystem at sri arc presents a detailed proposal for a standard telnet protocol karp page rfc categorization guide to nwg rfc s february d nil del and form machines nwg rfc s nil del and form machines are proposals of similar methods for adapting user programs and or data to the network a committee chaired by j heafner has been formed to plan implement and exercise a language for reconfiguring data streams in particular nil network interchange language described in introduces the concept of an abstract network machine which would permit a user to consider the computer network as an overall computing facility all dialogue would take place between hosts and the network machine nil permits the description of the environment and the description of the front end of an interactive system sublanguages for describing control operation data declaration and environment are used with nil the network machine can operate in standard mode as well as user defined extended mode the network machine can act as a user of a host conversely a host can be a user of a network machine each host will have a generator to generate a translator from the descriptive sublanguage inputs del decode encode language described in utilizes a front end translator at the using site to translate the using site characters to the server host character set return messages are subsequently translated locally to the local standard immediate feedback in an interactive mode is also handled locally del can be used for the operation of large display oriented systems provisions are given for representing a universal hardware the syntax is included two proposals for the form machine have been given introduces the concept of the form machine an experimental software package operating on regular expressions that describe data formats presents a different approach a syntax driven interpreter which operates on a grammar which is an ordered set of replacement rules contains a description of the form machine with some examples of replacement rules for particular data types application of the form machine to program protocols is also discussed proposes a message description language as a standard symbolic method for defining and describing binary messages in the future the descriptive language could be used as input to generators of data translation programs proposes the use of message data types prior to the development of network languages specifying the syntax and semantics of messages karp page rfc categorization guide to nwg rfc s february programs would extract the message data type and transform the data accordingly both standard and local types would be handled as in rfc probably using tables stored at one location such as nic presents data typed codes includes a discussion on a front end for nls t and suggests that further study be given to standard languages as presented in d record message boundaries nwg rfc s positions that no special structures should be imposed on data transmission are presented in and and disagree claims that logical and physical message distinctions exist and that logical messages must begin on a physical message boundary reports a decision from a meeting that records may begin anywhere in a message in a later meeting and the issue was reopened discussion included consideration of methods of indicating the end of message and alternatives were given earlier rfcs had discussed these alternatives proposes a length message to specify eof proposes use of a bit count preceding the transmission and discusses solutions to the problem of dropping bits d network graphics nwg rfc s proposals specifying network graphics protocol are in the formative stages in particular mentions lil in interpretable language at lincoln labs that can handle interactive graphics and discuss the formation of a working group to specify procedures for using graphics over the network states that graphics oriented descriptions will added to the form machine is a proposal for a network standard format for a data stream to control graphics displays announces a network graphics meeting to be hosted by mit and suggests discussion topics both and are attempts to stimulate some interest in the generation of graphics protocol proposals karp page rfc categorization guide to nwg rfc s february describes a harvard mit graphics experiment using the network comments on and presents an alternate proposal d file transmission nwg rfc s the subject of file transmission over the network is at the informal discussion stage nothing substantive has been published as nwg rfcs om this category in particular proposes using a length message to specify eof recommends routing multiple connections over the same link to handle file transmissions over the network and summarize comments on file transmission problems aired at the network meeting in houston nov describes how pdp file transmission could be handled over the network e measurement on network official document none unresolved issues should ncps be altered to keep measurement statistics e general nwg rfc s both and report on the comments made at the network meeting houston regarding network measurements ucla and bbn are officially responsible for gathering network statistics is it reasonable to alter the ncp to keep statistics e clock nwg rfc s the nwg rfcs in this category discuss requirements for a clock to measure network delay karp page rfc categorization guide to nwg rfc s february in particular is concerned with the installation of a real time clock at sri arc and requests comments concerning network time standards for delay measurement responds to stating that a millisecond clock should be sufficient discusses the desirability of adding a network clock for measurement of user oriented message delays a one millisecond resolution is a reasonable specification the problems of clock synchronization and long term accuracy are addressed describes the sri arc clock on the xds f network experience nwg rfc s reports on experience with the network are starting to be published as sites begin to get their ncps up more notes in this category should be generated and are encouraged in particular describes ncp checkout
