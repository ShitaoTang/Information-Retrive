 network working group b wessler request for comments telenet communications nic august references rfc revelations in network host measurements the purpose of rfc was to identify a problem we had encountered in using the arpanet at utah the primary thrust of the paper was supposed to be here is a place to make the network better rather than look isn t the network terrible the accepted use of seems to be the latter rather than the former a second purpose of was to stimulate the undertaking of measurement experiments on other computers and operating systems in addition to tenex very little in the way of measurements has been reported other than hal murray s rfc measuring tenex since the publication of rfc bbn has done a considerable amount of work to improve host net performance on tenex they reported new measurement results in their april quarterly progress report no i feel it is important to circulate those results to the rfc community don allen at bbn borrowed greg hicks rjs program and updated it to take advantage of recent changes in tenex improved the code near the input output jsys and used considerably faster network monitor code the result was approximately improvement from seconds of cpu time per megabit to seconds per megabit of the seconds were spent in the rjs program and in tenex network output the six seconds seem to relate very well to bbn ftp requirements where cpu seconds per megabit were required for bit byte transfers going to or bit bytes improves this figure by a factor of resulting in a cost of per megabit of the seconds left in rjs no attempt was made to improve or even discover where the time was spent this extra effort was not expended because rjs is soon to be replaced by the rje protocol which uses ftp as its transfer mechanism in summary i believe that the original rfc and the recent bbn results show that the network including the host cost is intrinsically effective if care is not taken in monitor and user code the system may not look very attractive i hope everyone now goes out and measures how good or bad they are doing vis a vis wessler page rfc revelations in network host measurements august network transfers please send me the results personally if they are too embarrassing to distribute via rfc it would be nice to hear from all systems all the data is courtesy of don allen and jerry burchfiel at bnn this rfc was put into machine readable form for entry into the online rfc archives by lorrie shiota wessler page
