 network working group j pickens request for comments ucsb computer systems laboratory nic july evaluation of arpanet services january through march abstract rfc exercising the arpanet described a group organized at ucsb to investigate the network resources the stated goals were to develop problem solving capability and in the process produce helpful criticism for the nodes investigated this report summarizes the group s experiences and finding and suggests network refinements to improve user satisfaction the group s encounter with arpanet included many unexpected problems and difficulties most worthy of mention are software heterogeneity and inadequate documentation from this first hand experience the group has formulated criteria for ease in use of network resources the report presents these criteria as well as suggestions for improved documentation better utilization of current resources and a plea for regular usage of inter personal communications facilities individual sites have been graded on reliability response and friendliness comments regarding specific sites have been included to help in adapting to the needs of uninitiated users despite problems encountered in the initial nine week exposure enough was learned of arpanet resources to enable the group to write useful software programs to effect automatic login file transfer and interprocess communication have been written and put to use table of contents background approach goals the survey extent and duration statistical results critique of arpanet services a site measurement parameter friendliness software critique community spirit economics pickens page rfc evaluation of arpanet services july suggestions for improvement software community spirit conclusion appendix a sample of survey questionnaire appendix b grades and comments for specifics sites background approach the test group was organized from a group of electrical engineering graduate students in computer science within the group was represented a substantial degree of experience with high level languages and time sharing systems such as the dartmouth basic and ucsb mathematical graphics systems however no one had experience in exercising arpanet and few knew what resources the arpanet represented after two weeks of presentation from jim white and roland bryan the group was turned loose for open experimentation enthusiasm was high as each group managed to locate and decode the login procedures for various nodes and began to learn how to use the available resources in fact half of the weekly seminar time was devoted to sharing learned experiences and procedures interest however lagged some as the quarter progressed due to poor network site reliability few active nodes and hard to locate documentation only five out of fourteen students remained active after the first quarter goals the primary goal of the group was to learn how to use and to evaluate network resources it was decided to be fair but direct in evaluating each site including ucsb since the level of networking experience was initially low the evaluation criteria was dictated mostly by gut feelings at the conclusion of the first quarter s effort a questionnaire was given to the students a sample of which is included in appendix a pickens page rfc evaluation of arpanet services july the group response is summarized for overall performance below data for individual sites is presented in appendix b some of the questions asked were the following estimate percentage of time spent in various trouble states estimate the mean time to failure describe personal experience with the network suggest improvements grade the investigated nodes on the factors of reliability response and friendliness the survey extent and duration during the period in which the major effort was expended january march relatively few nodes were active experimentation therefore concentrated most heavily on ucsb bbn tenex mit multics and sri arc minor investigation was performed of harv ucla nmc and ucla ccn the remaining sites were either inactive or inaccessible for lack of documentation activity included the following game playing e g chess life and doctor at bbn tenex text and file manipulation e g col nls teco inter personal communication link and sndmsg on line compilation e g tenex fortran multics pl statistical results figure below summarizes the overall response to the questionnaire given to the group after nine weeks experience with the arpanet individual exposure varied from ten to sixty hours and twelve students responded each survey item is presented as a group average sum and is supplemented with a low and a high value to show the range of response the questions were slightly ambiguous in that they failed to distinguish between node inactivity and local ncp inactivity also some figures may reflect individual students inadequacy in understanding local and foreign procedures nevertheless the data is interesting as a look into uninitiated user experience pickens page rfc evaluation of arpanet services july figure survey item average low high of time unable to log in any site of time unable to log into desired site of time foreign site suddenly crashes of time local site suddenly crashes of time trouble free operation approximate mean time between failure h min hrs total time invested hrs hrs hrs first to be noted is that considering the entire arpanet complex no one approximated the mean time between failure at more than two hours secondly the average time for trouble free operation was a figure untenable for regular user usage in all fairness however some sites were much more trouble free than others and individuals tend to define the term by the level of their own competence and experience thus explaining the high of and the low of critique of arpanet services a site measurement parameter friendliness much discussed by the group was the concept of friendliness especially as it applies to on line systems the following definition of friendliness is offered based on direct network experience friendliness is concise complete and available documentation easy system usage e g minimum numbers of keys for login system and job status readily available easy to reach help both on line people and on line files no messages overkill as sometimes unexpectedly occurs during login reasonable reliability and response time concise but informative error diagnostics the reader can probably think of more criteria but these were the outstanding points of friendliness generated specifically by the group s experience pickens page rfc evaluation of arpanet services july software critique initial experimentation concentrated on login procedures canned scenarios e g abhay k bhushan s arpanet scenario rfc game playing and inter personal communication as the effort continued attempts were made to solve problems at various nodes one student for example programmed a newton raphson root finder in pl at mit multics a blackbody problem in fortran at bbn tenex and mit multics and in pl at mit multics and a discrete fourier transform in basic at bbn tenex it is the group s conclusion that small problems can be written in a half hour entered and edited in fifteen minutes and debugged in another fifteen minutes for small problems the current arpanet software resources are quite adequate by far the most annoying difficulty was obtaining adequate documentation the resource notebook was found to be interesting but of limited utility information about each node s ncp which was requested in february is still unavailable significant variations in procedures were found in executing similar tasks on different nodes consider for example the wide variety of text editors with unique file naming editing and manipulation commands tenex teco col nls consider too the wide variety of compilation load and execute procedures rje for ucsb edit save compile save load execute for tenex systems even more disparate are the executive level commands with all their varieties tenex s control c ucla nmc s x ucsb s reset all of which return to the top lvel software heterogeneity is a stumbling block to the user residents of large nodes are hard pressed to find problems which should be solved outside of the local environment with ucsb s mathematical graphics on line system and direct access to batch the group experienced apprehensive twinges spending hours on the network solving problems which could be solved in minutes locally community spirit individuals sometimes got the impression erroneously it is hoped that some researchers in the arpa community had little desire to consult and or help on the other hand others bent over backwards in giving assistance the group had hoped for a more consistent response pickens page rfc evaluation of arpanet services july there was difficulty in locating the source of responsibility for resource development it seemed to the seminar group that the complete distribution of responsibility negated incentive to locate document and create useful network resources economics network economics at levels above as well as the communications level are a big user problem e g if distributed computing is allowed then distributed billing is a necessity it is frustrating to watch accounts randomly die at different nodes and have to spend weeks in monetary renovation this problem was experienced with a site which a randomly changed passwords and then b eliminated its free account also there is a problem with double connect charges e g per hour at ucsb to sign on to bbn tenex at per hour which totals to per hour suggestions for improvement in spite of the many difficulties and frustrations the class was impressed with the potential of arpanet and produced several suggestions for improvement software working groups should be organized to define problems which require the use of a significant set of the network resources the arpanet represents a great resource already even with telnet as the only operational protocol more effort should be put in utilization of what currently exists two illustrative examples follow a by combining the resources represented by ucsb s ols and ucsb s telnet user programs were created to sign on automatically to the various sites thus a network user need know only the sign on procedure for ucsb all settings of local remote echo character line at a time upper lower case etc are taken care of automatically by the pre written user programs b combining the resources of telnet protocol pl subroutine calls to the ucsb ncp and o s multi programming a group of students created a batch fed command language in pl to communicate via telnet with foreign sites this program has been used successfully to investigate file transfer nic files are regularly copied on x white printer paper and cards will soon be transferred to i tenex interprocess communication a program was started at bbn tenex to be used as pickens page rfc evaluation of arpanet services july a subroutine locally plans exist to initiate and monitor a chess game between bbn tenex and su ai and data transfer pre formatted files of data have been transferred from ucla nmc to ucsb ucla nmc will soon make available survey and measurement data ala telnet protocol and through direct icp moe details of this program will be available in a future report documentation a self sufficient mini user manual miniman should exist for each site and also for each function network wide such as the fortran compilers the miniman would be similar in some respects to the resource notebook but would be more oriented to helping the user run a site dependent miniman would contain the following sign on procedure simple file manipulation and editing commands compilation and execution instructions telnet access brief summary of programs and subroutines direction on how to get help overall documentation of hardware software and human resources should be more complete a documentation questionnaire should perhaps be circulated to authors of network programs including the authors of network control programs merging information from the questionnaire with the resource notebook would facilitate the construction of a resource location cross referenced index such an index perhaps on line would aid the network user in locating both software and hardware whatever the final scheme more planning is required to improve the user versus documentation battle the recent effort in this direction by marshall d abrams entitled serving remote users on the arpanet nic rfc is well timed and should be thoroughly considered finally high level subroutine calls to each ncp such as those offered by ucsb should be universally available community spirit networks have great though unexploited potential for inter personal communication the communication resources nic s journal nls tenex s sendmsg link ucla nmc s s msg c to name a few are used today only by the proficient few but should be utilized regularly by all two symptoms of the current state of network communications from the group s point of view are that most procedural information was shared verbally in class and that many pickens page rfc evaluation of arpanet services july problems in locating documentation were solved by a last resort to that old standby the telephone improved communications will stimulate cooperation on joint projects names and interests of programmers researchers willing to cooperate on joint projects and corresponding blue sky lists of software projects should be maintained a network news and notes should be published to inform and advise network participants of new resources and procedural modifications care must be taken however to keep this document concise i e avoid message over kill perhaps a one page flier published weekly would meet this need a network consulting center should be created perhaps at the existing nic which would specialize in non partisan matching of network users to network resources a strong potential of the network is in computer science education being exposed to many varieties of computer systems helps the student user avoid the narrowness of experience and opinion which sometimes exists in centers of learning and computing in this respect the tip user is probably the most benefited as for little investment in local resources many styles of systems are at his finger tips yet even for service nodes the network represents an inexpensive extension to local educational resources current efforts to tap the educational value of arpanet should be encouraged and extended conclusion existing site surveys measure and evaluate the performance of imp hardware host hardware and host ncp programs but little has been done to evaluate software performance the ucsb ee graduate students attempted a primitive first pass evaluation of network resources in the period between january and march out of this effort have come definitions and criteria which would be useful to other individuals or agencies in developing evaluation schemes on the user protocol level to this end it is hoped that this report is useful pickens page rfc evaluation of arpanet services july appendix a sample student questionnaire arpanet grade given a excellent evaluation by f bad site reliability response friendliness hours comments used arpanet evaluation indicate of your sessions which were in the following categories state unable to log in to any site unable to log in to desired site foreign site suddenly crashes local site crashes trouble free operation other considering the performance of the local host communication network and remote hosts estimate the mean time to failure of arpanet mean time between failure what was your total time invested in the arpanet this quarter total time invested describe your overall experience with the arpanet e g rise and fall of personal interest factors involved etc what suggestions for changes or improvements or new capabilities do you have to make to arpanet hosts use back side or other paper for these questions if necessary pickens page rfc evaluation of arpanet services july appendix b specific sites grades and comments the following grades and comments are based on the two to four most representative questionnaire responses for each site reliability response and friendliness are averaged grades and reflect subjective criticism total invested time is the sum total of the experimentation times reported by individual respondents it is hoped that future evaluations might be more specific and complete than the current efforts yet the value of these initial efforts should not be underestimated grades a
