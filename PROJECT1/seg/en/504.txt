 network working group m padlipsky request for comments mit multics nic november multics address change we will be changing the network address of mit multics from to decimal on monday december please make any necessary table and program changes then and accept our apologies for the inconvenience the change was necessitated by the fact that there were some nine uses for the four ports on imp making the second mit imp desirable there were four very active hosts on imp making the shift of at least one of them to the new less busy imp desirable and the new multics machine is some feet from the old imp making it the logical candidate for the move it is likely that we will have one or two additional test sessions on the new imp prior to the changeover date these will be announced in our message of the day and would only affect temporarily users who cannot employ numeric host addresses directly received at nic this rfc was put into machine readable form for entry into the online rfc archives by lorrie shiota padlipsky page
