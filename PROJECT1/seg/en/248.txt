 network working group w hathaway request for comments ames nic april updates response to nwg rfc conventions for using an ibm terminal as a user console for access to network server hosts i would like to propose the following conventions to replace the ones proposed in rfc the original conventions suffer from lack of consideration of the correspondence and what i feel are inconsistencies and considerable difficulty of use the terminal with correspondence keyboard does not have all of the standard characters notably less than greater than logical not vertical bar thus we must not use any of these characters in our conventions if we wish to support the correspondence the dedication of certain characters to special functions involves a trade off the convenience of having the function as a single key versus the inconvenience of having to use two keys to enter the character as data i believe that only two of the special functions listed in rfc justify the dedication of a key the character escape function and the character delete function for the character escape function i recommend the cent sign as this character is on both the regular and correspondence terminals and is not in the ascii character set for the character delete function i recommend the backspace key for obvious reasons while there is some need to be able to enter the character backspace as for underscoring output etc i feel that the trade off mentioned above clearly indicates a single key character delete would be much more valuable than a single key backspace and a two key character delete for the other special functions i recommend two key combinations consisting of character escape and a key to define the function these are summarized below hathaway page rfc response to nwg rfc april character escape character delete backspace system delete line delete or nl logical line end line continuation nl ascii control the option in line delete is to allow the user to enter a new line nl immediately after the line delete to line up margins without entering a null line to enter a null line after a line delete would require two nl characters the two new functions defined above line continuation and ascii control are used as follows the line continuation is used to enter a line which is longer than the carriage or the margin placement will permit it can be looked on as the complement of the logical line end in that is allows you to enter one logical line on several physical lines the use of the ascii control function requires some background there are of course many characters in ascii which are keyed as combinations of control and another key the character escape function may be used to handle these control characters as follows a character escape followed by a letter will be the equivalent of the ascii control letter written as xc where x is the letter this will greatly simplify the conventions for users as they will simply key a where they are used to using ac and so forth for completeness however there needs to be a way to key the additional control characters which require both control and shift in addition to a letter such as esc which is shift mc further it is desirable that a more mnemonic system be provided for the non teletype user who knows he wants a lf but does not know that it is a jc to satisfy both of these needs i recommend the ascii control special function which is used to enter any of the ascii control character as followed by the standard two or three character abbreviation thus escape would be esc line feed would be lf and so forth the use of the variable length abbreviation does not introduce any ambiguity although from an implementation standpoint it may be advantageous to use the two character abbreviation proposed in rfc finally we must be able to enter the eight ascii graphics which do not appear on either terminal as well as the cent sign and backspace themselves without their special functions for these i recommend the following hathaway page rfc response to nwg rfc april for for for for for for for for for backspace for backspace note that the characters and do not appear on the correspondence and hence should not be used endnotes logical not cent sign this rfc was put into machine readable form for entry into the online rfc archives by lorrie shiota hathaway page
