 network working group edwin w meyer jr request for comments mit project mac nic november logger protocol error a conflict was recently discovered between the official ncp protocol as described in protocol document and the logger protocol as described in rfc by steve crocker steve suggested that we put out an rfc to alert the network community to this point in rfc it is proposed that an all allocate command be sent immediately following an rts or str request for connection this conflicts with the restriction stated in protocol document that an all command can be given only for an open connection to not be required to handle an all command before a connection is established is a simplifying restriction that an ncp implementation may take advantage of for example the multics ncp is currently designed this way for this reason and also because we believe that the ncp protocol should not be changed now except for critical reasons it is felt that the proposed logger protocol should be modified to agree with the existing ncp protocol this rfc was put into machine readable form for entry into the online rfc archives by alison de la cruz meyer page
