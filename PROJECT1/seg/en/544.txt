 network working group bill english sri arc request for comments no february some brief preliminary notes on the arc clock the arc clock system provides a time reference that is written into the core memory of the xds computer there are two types of time information available absolute and relative the absolute time is written into two adjacent words of core with the following format first word bits thru contain the month code in straight binary with a range of to bits thru contain the day code in straight binary with a range of to bits thru contain the year code in straight binary with range of to second word bits thru contain the hour code written in straight binary with a range of to bits thru contain the minute code written in straight binary with a range of to bits thru contain the second code written in straight binary with range ofr to these words are written once each second it is anticipated that the accuracy of the initial setting will be on the order of second as referred to wwv and that the oscillator drift rate will not account for an accumlated error of more than second every days the oscillator and clock are provided with standby power in order to maintain the accuracy of the system because of variable delays in time required to obtain access to the core memory it is anticipated that the short term accuracy will be on the order of to microseconds the relative time which is written into one word of core memory is simply the contents of a bit binary accumulator the rate at which the accumulator is updated can be chosen to be either once very micro seconds or once every millisecond in either case the core page rfc prelimary notes on the arc clock february location is written each time the accumulator is updated as above the short term accuracy will be about to microseconds and the long term accuracy will be the equivalent of one second every days this rfc was put into machine readable form for entry into the online rfc archives by katsunori tanaka page
