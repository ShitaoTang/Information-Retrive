 network working group c stephen carr request for comments utah september network subsystem for time sharing hosts introduction a set of network primitives has been defined network working group note for inclusion in the monitor systems of the respective hosts these primitives are at the level of system calls spop s or brs s on the uuo s on the pdp presumably these uuo s are accessible to all user programs when executing for users whose status bits allow network access in addition to user program access a convenient means for direct network access from the terminal is desirable a sub system called telnet is proposed which is a shell program around the network system primitives allowing a teletype or similar terminal at a remote host to function as a teletype at the serving host system primitives g deloche of u c l a has documented a proposed set of basic network primitives for inclusion in the operating systems of the respective hosts nwg note the primitives are open primary connection open auxiliary connection transmit over connection close connection the details and terminology are defined by deloche and others in previous memos the primitives are system calls available to programmers and are most likely a part of the resident monitor rather than the swappable executive basic terminal access in addition to user programming access it is desirable to have a subsystem program at each host which makes the network immediately accessible from the teletype without special programming subsystems are commonly used system components such as text editors compilers and interpreters the first network related subsystem should allow carr page rfc network subsystem for time sharing hosts september users at host a to connect to host b and appear as a regular terminal user to host b it is expected that more sophisticated subsystems will be developed in time but this basic one will render the early net immediately useful teletype terminal user serving host host a b university stanford of utah research institute figure user accesses distant serving host via shunt subsystem in his own host computer simple dialogue pdp to a user at utah is sitting at a teletype dialed into the university s dual pdp s he wishes to operate the cal sub system on the at sri in menlo park california login pdp login r telnet the pdp run command is issued to call and start the telnet subsystem escape character is the user indicates an escape character which telnet will watch for in subsequent input from the user connect to sri the telnet subsystem will make the appropriate system call uuo to establish a primary connection the connection will be established provided sri is willing to accept another foreign user the utah user is cleared for network access at utah this is determined by a status word kept in the pdp carr page rfc network subsystem for time sharing hosts september monitor for each user login carr the user logs in sri characters typed on the user s teletype are transmitted unaltered through the pdp user host and on to the serving host the exception to this is a possible one for one code conversion required between the ucla sigma and the pdp for example cal the pdp telnet subsystem switches to full duplex character by character transmission since this is required by s characters typed by the user are underlined full duplex operation is allowed for by the pdp though not used by most dec subsystems the user wishes to load a cal file into cal from the file system on his local pdp cal at your service read file from netwrk netwrk is a predefined name similar to paper tape or teletype the file opening brs is set to expect an auxiliary connection and the file from utah netwrk dsk myfile cal the user types the prescribed escape character followed by the telnet command to send the desired file to sri on an auxiliary connection the user s next statement is in cal again the telnet subsystem the telnet subsystem coding should fit easily into one core page for it does very little it effectively establishes a shunt in the user host between the remote user and the serving host telnet commands are carr page rfc network subsystem for time sharing hosts september escape char is declares a character which telnet will watch for subsequent strings typed between this character and a carriage return are not shunted through to the serving host but sent instead to the telnet program in the user s local host this escape character is not the same as the user s host rubout character connect to the official site name of the desired serving host is typed i e sri utah ucla ucsb telnet attempts to establish a connection if the attempt is successful the following characters are shunted through the user s local machine the connection places the user in the pre logged in state at the serving host logout telnet issues the logout command sequence to the serving host if the user simply rubs out and kills his pdp job the pdp will indicate to the that the connection is closed the system primitives do whatever they do when a normal dataphone connection is suddenly broken copy file a file copying command is available in telnet to move data along on auxiliary connections from the user s host file system to the serving host carr page rfc network subsystem for time sharing hosts september on the this is copy to netwrk on the pdp netwrk dsk these telnet commands are accepted when the telnet subsystem is first entered or following the declared escape character conclusion given the basic system primitives the telnet subsystem at the user host and a manual for the serving host the network can be profitably employed by a remote user telnet subsystem constitutes a level network program which will quickly be surpassed it is however simple enough to be working fairly soon editor s note has been used in this document to indicate end of line in place of the original handwritten arrows this rfc was put into
