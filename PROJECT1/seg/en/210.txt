 network working group january request for comments r t braden nic ccn as a network service center a introduction ccn the campus computing network of ucla will shortly be connected to the arpa network as a host of the service center type the purpose of this rfc is to describe the hardware and software available at ccn and the services we are now planning to provide to other network hosts these services and their implementation priority were chosen in consultation with a particular site rand which plans to use ccn via the network we would welcome requests and comments from other sites b ccn hardware ccn operates an ibm kk i e a model cpu with a million byte fast memory cpu speed highly program dependent mips with mips as a useful average the upper end of this range occurs heavy floating point in the inner loops the decimal arithmetic operation of a should be avoided as they are executed interpretively by the memory speed memory is interleaved ways and extensively buffered effective memory fetch time is ns in lower million bytes ns in upper million bytes i o con figuration a selector channels b multiplexor channcl with control unit rpq c disk storage units i e disk drives d drum systems residence and catalog only e x track tape drives o bpi f x tracts tape drives bpi g modified crt operator maintenance console braden page rfc ccn as a network service center january also on the multiplexor channel are h card readers and high speed printers at ccn i four baud interfaces for cci alphanumeric tv display consoles currently supporting consoles j six data communication ports dial baud dedicated baud and dedicated baud for remote batch entry terminals k a calcomp plotter l an interface for bbs teleputers the culler fried system m ten dial ports for typewriter terminals and finally n the imp interface c operating system the model operates under the ibm supplied mvt version of os currently release this system contains a set of modifications developed at ccn for control of batch job flow mvt is a realization of the general process model of multiprogramming although this fact is obscured by ibm s terminology for example a process is called a task in mvt while the fork primitive is called attach d user software processors ccn provides the following user software a the usual fortran compilers fort g fort h watfor b pl version and pl c cornell s student pl c assembler g d ibm algol f e ibm linkage editor f and a fast in core linkage editor written at ccn braden page rfc ccn as a network service center january f miscellaneous processors including cobol spi xp meta snobol lisp autoflow simscript mix knuth s student machine csmp gpss ecap apt pms matlan symap spss and the bmd series g the ibm file utilities sort and rpg interactive systems a ursa conversational remote job entry system based on alphanumeric display consoles ibm and cci cc consoles ursa provides a number of other services including a desk calculator an interactive interpretive assembler and on line utilities for manipu lation of the os file system it also con tains the ccn operator interface to mvt ursa is not suitable for typewriter interaction because it is designed for instantaneous dis play of at least characters at a time b apl ibm program product version of this well known interactive system currently supports ibm s selectric typewriter terminals only c olms ucla implementation of the culler fried system nearly identical in language to the ucsx on line system d tso ibm s new general purpose time sharing subsystem under mvt to be available at ccs sometime during tso supports s and teletypes and at ccn it will support cci consoles tso is reminiscent of ctss in its capabilities and command language e remote job service the rjs remote job service subsystem was written by ccn to support remote batch terminals communicating over dial and leased lines a remote batch terminal consists of a set of unit record devices one or more card readers printers and punches driven either by a hardwired controller or by a small cpu e g ibm model or a remote rjs user enters os jobs complete with jcl into the remote reader the jobs are spooled into the operating system and run in their turn and the printed and or punched output is braden page rfc ccn as a network service center january returned to the remote terminal from which the jobs originated unless the user or operator re routes the output the remote terminal may also include a console typewriter to be used by the remote operator to receive and send messages and to exert control over his terminal f fast batch subsystem ccn has written a fast batch subsystem called quickrun to provide instant turnaround for small simple batch jobs which are common in a university computing center quickrun accepts a very simple job control language qcl without much of the generality of os jcl quickrun is really a batch job control subsystem which itself runs essentially as a job within mvt because of its lack of generality the quickrun subsystem creates much less system overhead than normal os batch this is reflected in lower cost per job in quickrun quickrun is available at remote batch terminals through rjs as well as through a self service card reader at ccn g special considerations core memory for batch jobs ccn can easily run batch jobs requiring up to million bytes although jobs over k bytes will normally not run during prime time disk space ccn provides extensive on line disk space for permanent files the resident disk pack configuration includes m bytes packs of user source programs for use through ursa m bytes packs of user object and load modules binary decks and other files m bytes of limited time storage n days where n is published number satisfying n this space is charged for at about s per kilobyte per month in the future we plan to significantly extend this on line space by implementing a tertiary storage system using magnetic tapes in addition a batch job may always request that the user s own disk pack be mounted thus allowing very large private collections braden page rfc ccn as a network service center january of files rates batch charges are based upon t cpu time i number of i o requests and r core memory region size the current rate schedule may be obtained from mr kenneth tom user relations supervisor ucla campus computing network math sciences addition los angeles california generally speaking the ccn model cost is very attractive for compute bound heavy floating point calculations particularly where large regions are required for most other jobs the ccn machine is competitive with other cost recovery computing centers which operate without special subsidy g service to network ccn currently plans to provide rjs ursa and eventually tso service to the network each of these will have its own third level protocol in addition there will be a transparent third level protocol to allow a user written program running in batch or tso at ccn to converse directly with the network the third level protocols in the order in which we plan to implement them are as follows netrjs netrjs is the name of the third level protocol by which a user process in a remote host will simulate a remote batch terminal connected to ccn s rjs system thus netrjs will allow a user to submit complete batch jobs to the and receive their print and punch output streams back over the network netrjs has been specified in rfc and implementation is targeted for march netcrt this protocol will allow a network user to simulate an idealized cci alphanumeric display console and use ccn s ursa system and eventually ts an initial version of netcrt will be circulated shortly as an rfc braden page rfc ccn as a network service center january nettrans this is the transparent protocol allowing a user process at ccn to talk over the network it has not yet been specified nettype this protocol will allow a real or simulated to use ts and perhaps apl via the network h
