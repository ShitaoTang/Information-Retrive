 network working group e harslem request for comments j heafner rand march comments on protocol re nwg rfc we offer the following suggestions to be considered as additions to the april th protocol grammar specifications error messages it is desirable to include debugging aids in the initial protocol for checking out network control programs etc there are three classes of errors content errors status errors and resource allocation or exhaustion specifies the class and the offending member of the class the command is returned to the sending ncp for identification and analysis examples of status errors are messages sent over blocked links and attempts to unblock an unblocked link examples of content errors are an invalid rfc complete a message sent on a link not connected closing of an unconnected link and an attempt to unblock an unconnected link examples of resource errors are a request for a non existent program and connection table overflow etc resource errors should be followed by a in response to the queries or queries provide an extension to the facility as well as limited error recovery thus avoiding re initialization of an ncp the first command requests the remote ncp to supply the status of all connections to the user specified by the user number in the second is the reply contains the connection status information if an ncp wants the status of all connections to a remote host the is zero harlsem heafner page rfc comments on protocol re nwg rfc march program termination notification this command supplements rather than replaces it severs all communication between a program and those programs in a given host to which it is connected this command performs what would otherwise be handled by multiple commands contains the sender s user number host status these messages host coming up and host voluntarily going down are compatible with asynchronous interrupt driven programs as opposed to the more conventional post poll method transmit and broadcast unlike the previous commands these are not sent over the control link but rather over links assigned to user programs the prefix of or indicates to the receiving ncp the disposition of the message body indicates a message to be passed to a single process specifies to the destination ncp that the message is to be distributed over all receiving connections linked to the sender in response to a system call by the user to an ncp requesting the ncp generates one to each host to which the sender is connected rfc and dynamic reconnection this protocol is complex it proliferates control messages it causes queues to become associated with re entrant procedures that are artificially imposed via the protocol remote aen assignment and discounts the situation where only controlling process a has knowledge that slave process b should be rung out in a dynamic reconnection the etc are suggestions for inclusion as additions in the april th protocol specifications the above criticism is of course not intended to affect modification of the rfc structure by april th nor to reflect on those who planned it we have not studied the problem it is meant however to voice our concern harlsem heafner page rfc comments on protocol re nwg rfc march about complexity and resulting response times this is a difficult problem and it deserves more study after we have exercised the current rfc specifications we hope to offer constructive suggestions with respect to the rfc in the future jfh hs this rfc was put into machine readable form for entry into the online rfc archives by mario vitale harlsem heafner page
