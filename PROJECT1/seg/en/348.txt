 network working group a k bhushan request for comments mit project mac nic october scenarios for using arpanet computers this scenario booklet is provided to facilitate the use of arpanet host computer systems via the arpanet the objective of these scenarios is to aid a user in sampling host computers on the arpanet thereby stimulating this interest in using arpanet the scenarios describe the login procedure the use of some simple or interesting facilities and obtaining on line help facilities such as on line documentation and interactive dialog with experienced users via link or message type mechanisms the use of telnets for piggy back login is included to help system programmers in debugging and testing their protocol implementations an exercise of editing and running a very simple program is also included where appropriate the scenarios assume the environment of the mit dmcg pdp computer system but are readily adaptable to use from other systems the annotated script is provided to assist you in the use of a particular host computer comments are enclosed in parenthesis and user input is underlined in the scripts a carriage return is indicated by and a space by blank i e no type escape to local user telnet is indicated by backslash the default escape character in the mit dmcg system additional blank lines have been introduced in many instances to improve readability of the script acknowledgments the author wishes to acknowledge the help of bob bressler rich guida bob metcalfe jim michener and neal ryan in preparing this scenarios booklet note your
