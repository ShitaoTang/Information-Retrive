 network working group bob thomas rfc bbn nic april workshop announcement title automated resource sharing on the arpanet date monday may time am to pm place bolt beranek and newman inc cambridge mass hosts tenex and tip groups at bbn theme this workshop will focus on various aspects of the question what steps can be taken to automate access to the distributed resources on the arpanet in particular how can we move from where we are today toward an environment which facilitates resource sharing by moving the burden of dealing with the network from the human user to processes which act on his behalf additionally operating systems themselves perform various operations not directly initiated by human users which could better be performed with the availability of resources on other systems e g file system backup how can we move toward an environment which facilitates such system system cooperation objectives of workshop to identify and clarify the issues raised by automated resource sharing what are the obstacles preventing more widespread resource sharing on the arpanet are they technical political administrative in nature is it that there are few resources worth sharing we don t think so is automated sharing a bad idea we don t think so thomas page rfc workshop announcement april to identify resources at various network sites appropriate for automated sharing and to identify the need for resources which don t but should exist to formulate a series of experiments for the purpose of evaluating relative merits and disadvantages of different approaches to automating resource sharing the intent of such experimentation is to gain experience through construction and use of prototype systems which support automated sharing format of workshop morning in order to get the workshop up to speed each participant will be expected to give a brief presentation of relevant work he his site is currently engaged in is planning to do or to identify and discuss issues he feels are relevant to the subject time will be allowed for brief discussion after each presentation afternoon general discussion of the issues raised during the morning session possible subjects for discussion include but need not be limited to identification of possible multi site services intersite mail terminal linking status information are some examples what are others identification of resources appropriate for remote utilization file systems compilers on line query systems manuscript preparation systems are some examples what are others access to remote resources possibility of access paths other than the standard logger port to what extent if at all can the access paths to a variety of different resources be standardized how can resources which may move from host to host or may be available on several hosts be dynamically located and selected for use the need for desirability of a broadcast icp problems of accounting for resource utilization some form of network wide accounting would be a great convenience for example it would be nice if a user could use the same account at many all sites what are the problems if any preventing this thomas page rfc workshop announcement april problems of security and access control authentication of users processes attempting to use resources as with network wide accounts the ability to use the same name and password at all sites would be convenient how can a user s password and other sensitive data be protected in such an environment the notion of a third party password validation and user authentication service approaches to automating resource sharing it is possible without difficulty to identify several which on the surface appear to be different a multi site executive programs which make resources accessible to the user at the command language level e g the inter site user user interaction and file maintenance activity supported by the rsexec b a programming language environment designed to facilitate resource sharing e g lisp is a machine independent language one could imagine a multi computer lisp system which supported automated resource sharing c the collect a resource approach identify an editor here file storage service there a compiler somewhere else etc and build a workshop environment which provides convenient access to these resources what are the relative merits and disadvantages of these approaches what aspects do these approaches have in common is it possible to identify a common base capable of supporting them all protocols to support automated resource sharing it would be inappropriate to attempt to generate a detailed protocol specification at this workshop however it is appropriate to discuss the kinds of activity a protocol should support existing protocols excepting host host protocol and possibly the new telnet protocol appear to be oriented toward human users automated resource sharing suggests processes acting on behalf of human users to interface to remote resources this in turn suggests that the protocols should be highly process oriented for example because there should be minimal human intervention in error recovery the protocols should be extremely robust e g include well specified time outs etc thomas page rfc workshop announcement april arrangements if you are planning to attend the workshop please notify bob thomas at bbn send net mail to bthomas bbn telephone x if you would like us to make motel reservations for you at the homestead inn at fresh pond call mrs terry bernier at bbn x it is possible that a single day will prove to be insufficient for this workshop if that is the consensus of the attendees the workshop will continue through tuesday may position papers memos notes etc prepared by participants in advance of the workshop will help contribute to the success of the workshop and are requested all such papers received before may will be distributed in advance to workshop attendees the following questions may be helpful in focusing your thinking what resources would your site be willing to make available for use in automated resource sharing experiments under what conditions would your site be willing or able to participate in such experiments what administrative and or technical considerations would prevent your site from entering into a network wide resource sharing agreement if you employ accounting procedures that require cost recovery how if at all should they be modified to work in a network resource sharing environment reading list we are aware of little that has been written on the subject of automated resource sharing however the following items are relevant at least marginally to the workshop please inform us of others of which you are aware
