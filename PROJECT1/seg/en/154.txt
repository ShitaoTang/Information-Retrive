 network working group b cosell request for comments bbn nic august categories b updates none obsoletes none imp system change notification during the week of august we installed a new version of the imp system version the new version incorporated three principal changes the number of hosts the system can handle was increased from three to four although this caused a rather large internal change to the imp the only external effects of the change are the presence of a new status light light monitors host and the lengthening of the second and snapshot statistics the host handling routines were modified to gather more accurate and voluminous statistics on host usage of the network and report them to ncc the sec statistics were changed to measure time for the host round trip statistic in units of rather than microseconds it is not anticipated that the new system should have any direct effect on the hosts this rfc was put into machine readable form for entry into the online rfc archives by bbn corp under the direction of alex mckenzie page
