 network working group h murray request for comments computer corporation of america nic january cca iccc weather demo the weather demo originally developed for the iccc show is now generally available it is a very nice network demo since it really can does run on two machines this demo is two independent programs together they try to answer english questions about the weather for example did it rain in boston on october the natural language program is written in lisp it is a modification of a system developed by t winograd at mit the other half is a primitive datacomputer the datacomputer provides network datamanagement facilities and will incorporate the trillion bit unicon currently being installed at ames the two programs communicate via datalanguage using the net weather now uses host as the location of the datacomputer this fixes the old cca not in the host tables bug keep in mind that is an evolving system we plan to improve weather and the datacomputer that it uses so things that work one day may get broken the next availability weather the lisp half is a real machine user both cpu and core we would obviously prefer that you run it on your machine if we are really empty which frequently happens at am feel free to run it on our machine since our system has no drum and weather takes all of core please check with somebody at cca before running weather if we are doing anything at all it is really a major load on our machine since the datacomputer is less of a load the system will be more available if you can run weather on your machine we will try to run the datacomputer during non prime time it can be thought of as the server half of this combination prime time here is to pm eastern time but the morning is frequently quite busy too please do not use the datacomputer during this time it will save us the effort of turning it off currently only one user at a time can run a limitation of the datacomputer that will go away someday murray page rfc cca iccc weather demo january if you want to run a demo not just play around we will probably be able to cooperate please call to make arrangements well in advance we strongly recommend that you do not try to give an important demo unless you have used both versions of the systems that will be used for the demo even we get in trouble when we forget to rehearse things a bit wednesday morning is scheduled preventive maintenance time our machine will not be up betwwen and but it frequently is down past noon more information for the latest information look at txt in at cca in particular message txt should be a quick summary of any other interesting txt files the latest version of this file in runoff format is announce rno the latest version of the lisp program will be in as weather sav normal ftp can be used to copy it it is pages it takes min to transfer it to ourselves min of cpu kbaud when the machine is very lighly loaded be sure to set the byte size to tenex command to ftp since this is a save file problems if you find any problems with lisp half please use sndmsg to send things to jeff hill he is jmh cca we are interested in examples which look like they should work but don t if you have any comments about general operations glitches like the datacomputer is not up bitch to me hgm cca cca is host decimal octal using the system after starting weather the system will initialize itself type out some messages and ask for the julian date really the day number of the year of today is the best answer that makes today be oct the last day of the iccc demo and one day past the latest data if you type some other number yesterday and last week won t work as well the system prompts with ready when it is ready to accept a sentence be sure to end the sentence with the proper punctuation sentences may be edited with a control a deletes last character or word typed r control r retypes sentence so far q control q deletes entire sentence murray page rfc cca iccc weather demo january x control x same as control q in addition two control characters can be used during the processing of sentences e control e aborts the processing of the sentence and returns to the ready state d control d aborts the whole system and causes it to re initialize itself during sentence input the system attempts to look up each word as it is typed and do spelling correction however since the names of all the cities are kept at the datacomputer the system accepts all unknown words as possible place names to be checked later on in the processing if the spelling corrector corrects one of your city names to a vocabulary word you can erase the word and retype it preceeded by an equal sign this forces the system to accept the word as a proper noun the system returns to the ready state after answering the question to terminate a session you may type goodbye which will leave you back at the tenex command level if the system cannot understand your request it tries to give you some explanatory message however it s not very good at explaining its behavior so you will usually get the default message sorry i couldn t understand that request if you really want to know why send us a transcriptipt of your session restrictions hints the system is not linguistically sophisticated it performs passably on sentences which would be considered simple requests for information it does not really understand the weather rather it understands how to compose retrieval requests for weather data in its data base a large set of example sentences can be found in sentences txt those sentences precede by a backslash do not work an explanatory comment preceeded by a semi colon explains the reasons for failure some of the others may not work either the major things that we know don t work are conjunction negation complex quantification murray page rfc cca iccc weather demo january sophisticated pronoun reference questions not involving weather e g what day was yesterday what cities are in massachusetts it is not working too well these days if you get in trouble try something withou it that is known to work what was the temperature in boston yesterday is better than most we are quite apt to test that phrase the system does not know about the word snow there is no way to list its vocabulary however the sentences in sentences txt should give you a good idea of the words the system undestands the average time for understanding and answering a question is about minute if the system takes much longer than this you should get suspicious if you ask a very big question like what was the hottest place in canada the lisp system may go into a gc garbage collention loop restarting all over with d will be ok but the datacomputer may take a long time to recover it doesn t yet notice that anything has gone wrong until it asks for more input data the data from oct thru is almost complete between oct to it is frequently sketchy we plan to reload everything sometime using september s data so we will have a complete month of clean data note this data has been extensively summarized it is probably not useful for people interested in weather the october data is about pages of real data plus about more for the inversion there are about cities the city names have been changed to the local city whenever possible i e boston is boston not logan alaska got lost somehow don t bother asking for it sample datalanguage these examples on this and the following pages work on a very old version of the datacomputer they are not the final form of datalanguage that should ba available soon murray page rfc cca iccc weather demo january the following question to weather generated two requests to the datacomputer the first uses the check port to verify that boston is a valid city name and the second uses the answer port to retrieve the data the actual requests that are sent to the datacomputer do not have the carriage returns that make them readable they are sent as one very long line the z is the end of data marker to weather has it rained in boston recently to the datacomputer or check place station with city eq boston place lp place city station city place rp place bsn station bsn place lp place region station region place rp end from the datacomputer boston massachusetts z to the datacomputer for the station with region eq massachusetts and city eq boston for answer ans observation with ge and date le ans lp ans city station city ans rp ans date observation date ans lp ans data precip ans data ans data ans rp end end murray page rfc cca iccc weather demo january and back from the datacomputer boston boston boston boston boston boston boston boston z and the final answer from weather was yes descriptions the
