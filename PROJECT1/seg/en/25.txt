 network working group d cantor request for comments computer corporation of america nic august storing network survey data at the datacomputer in november computer corporation of america cca and the programming technology division of the dynamics modeling system dms at m i t s project mac began planning to transmit to cca s datacomputer information about the behavior of arpa network hosts collected by dms s program survey the information was to be stored at the datacomputer and retrieved by an interactive program that would address the datacomputer from dms s pdp one goal of this joint project was to enable dms to retain all of the information that survey collects survey had been running since late saving only a short daily summary of its findings and discarding potentially useful details a second goal was to discover and remove shortcomings in the interface between cca s datacomputer and a program running at a remote host the project was completed last month and the programs described in this document have been operating successfully with the datacomputer since july part below describes survey s output part describes a program that retrieves portions of that output from the datacomputer part the survey database every twenty minutes dms s program survey wakes up and performs the initial connection protocol from the pdp at dms to the logger socket socket of each network hosts survey records a date time host status and response time for each host a host may be in one of these states undetermined or not surveyed disconnect from the network or dead network control program not responding icp to logger aborted by the host icp to logger timed out by survey after seconds cantor page rfc storing network survey data august logger available and responding within seconds survey records response times responding in tenths of seconds when the data for all hosts has been assembled survey transmits that data to cca s datacomputer if for some reason the datacomputer cannot accept the information it is held at dms and sent another time the datacomputer s survey database is inverted by host status month and year that is to say that the datacomputer maintains several indices to records of one attempt to establish a full duplex connection to one host s logger it maintains one such index for each host one for each status one for each month and one for each year the datacomputer can select records that are specified in boolean expressions by performing boolean operations on the inversion and without consulting the data itself the inversion thus facilitates rapid interaction between the survey retrieval program described below and the survey database at the datacomputer survey expresses the record of each attempt to access one host in ascii characters the record of one survey then occupies characters and each day the datacomputer receives characters from dms part retrieving survey data a program called surret written at dms in the language muddle allows one to selectively retrieve material from the survey data base stored at the datacomputer its user may specify values groups of values or where appropriate upper and lower bounds for values of each of five fields host name date time response time and host status in addition one may request that all five fields or any subset of the five be retrieved a sample interaction

the phrases in quotation marks are effectively surret prompts the status messages beginning with and were generated by the datacomputer the column headings and table were formatted by surret using figures retrieved from the datacomputer surret generates datalanguage sends it to the datacomputer and processes systems diagnostics and data sent to it from the datacomputer the datalanguage generated for the foregoing surret request was for survey logtry survey logtry with year eq and month eq and day eq and hrmin ge and hrmin le and host eq hrmin hrmin status status restime restime end the field names in the datalanguage were entered with file descriptors before the first data was loaded one can ask surret to retrieve new data by changing the values of any number of fields and issuing a new req request the command displays current values for the five prospective retrieval criteria thus ok host usc status restime date aug time between cantor page rfc storing network survey

information about the remaining two hosts detailed survey data from july forward is available either directly from the datacomputer or through surret persons who wish to use the datacomputer directly may obtain the pertinent documents through the nic or by contacting dale stern at cca endnotes an overview of the data computer is given in thomas marill the datacomputer oct pp nic a detailed study of the programming language for addressing the datacomputer is found in computer corporation of america datacomputer project working paper no datalanguage oct pp nic the current status of the language is reviewed in richard winter specifications for datalanguage version jun pp nic a user s manual for version will be released by cca in september cantor page rfc storing network survey data august survey is described in abhay bhushan a report on the survey project june nic a detailed discussion of surret is found in safwan bengelloun muddle survey data retrieval programs an internal dms memo of june our purpose here is to describe enough of the program s syntax and structure to show how it interacts with the datacomputer this rfc was put into machine readable form for entry into the online
