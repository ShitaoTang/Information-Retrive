 network working group alex mckenzie request for comments bbn jon postel mitre telnet and ftp implementation schedule change telnet and ftp implementation schedule change we have been contacted by several telnet implementers and concerned users regarding the scheduled changeover from old to new telnet there is a good deal of concern about accomplishing a coordinated changeover especially in light of the potential incompatibilities rfc nic therefore the changeover is reformulated as follows new telnet implementations are to be ready jan as before but are to use icp socket decimal that is the server telnet will listen on socket and user telnet programs will connect to socket it will also be useful for the user program to let the user optionally select the server socket as many user telnet programs currently do it will also be useful for implementers to consider a server telnet program capable of dealing with both protocols as mit dmcg has done rfc this will provide an opportunity for testing and debugging the new programs in a way that does not interfere with normal use during january we will survey the technical liaisons to determine the status of the telnet implementations as soon as we determine that the telnet implementations have reached a point where the changeover can be made without disruption of user services the technical liaisons will be notified in light of this change in the telnet implementation schedule the ftp schedule is also modified new ftp implementations are to be ready by feb as before but will continue to use icp socket decimal until we can determine that a changeover is appropriate references telnet protocol nic file transfer protocol nic this rfc was put into machine readable form for entry into the online rfc archives by mirsad todorovac mckenzie postel page
