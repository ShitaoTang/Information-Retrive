 network working group bernard cosell rfc bbn nic january categories b updates none obsoletes none imp system change notification we are planning to install a new version of the imp system version the new version is scheduled for field installation thursday january between noon and pm est and will require the assistance of imp site personnel at each site there were two principal problems with version both related to the delay inserted between the time when a host comes up and the time when its imp will accept the second packet from the host the first was that the delay was lengthened to slightly over seconds which caused hardware difficulties for some hosts the second was that there was an ambiguity that could make the delay run as long as a minute and a quarter on the first point the delay has been backed off from seconds to seconds as it was for imp systems prior to on the second point the ambiguity has been entirely removed note however that bbn report no on page specifies that the delay may range from to seconds and that future versions may require a longer delay in summary a host may come alive in one of two ways corres ponding to the two ways in which the host can go down if the host went down voluntarily by sending a host going down to the imp the host indicates his intention to come alive by sending the imp something if the host went down involuntarily by dropping his ready line the host indicates his intention to come alive by bringing his ready line back up in either case page the imp will refuse to accept more than one packet from the host for seconds after the host has indicated his intention to come alive notice however that the host must be prepared to accept all messages from the network from the instant that he indicates his intention to come alive this particular point seems to have given many hosts difficulty in running through their standard initialization procedures don t forget this simple and universal rule that when you are telling your imp that you are alive you must be prepared to always take every thing from the network whether or not the network is taking any thing from you version will also incorporate a few other changes mainly related to the operation of the ncc since the timeout is for a change being made shorter and the other modifications are minor there should be no appreciable transient with the coming of the new version in fact if the host does not accept messages from his imp pimmediately then the host may see the imp s ready line go down for second sometime during the second waiting period this is due to the following set of circumstances the imp periodically places nops on the queue for a dead host as part of the process of checking the imp host interface if a message remains on a host s queue for seconds without being taken the imp drops its ready line for second in order to clear the interface see rfc the timeout periods for the host queue and the delay when the host comes alive are not synchronized if the host is prepared to see the imp s ready line dropped during the second delay while coming alive then no harm will be done if messages from the imp are not accepted immediately bc jm this rfc was put into machine readable form for entry into the online rfc archives by bbn corp under the direction of alex mckenzie page
