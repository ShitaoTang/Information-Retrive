 network working group request for comments joel m winett nic lincoln laboratory categories telnet ll references rfc and october comments on telnet protocol changes through this rfc i am registering my objection to two of the three suggestions for changing the telnet protocol as described in rfc and am adding my suggestion for the interpretation of the telnet reverse break control code hide your input this code was originally put in the telnet protocol to give the virtual terminal the ability to simulate a real terminal which has the print suppress capability if the terminals being used at some installations do not have the ability to disable the printing mechanism the telnet being used can either ignore this code or attempt to simulate the function using other means e g blacking out a number of character positions and returning to the first character position every attempt should be made to allow a network user of a time sharing system to have the same facilities as a local user of the time sharing system the specification of telnet protocol should not limit the function of users if a function cannot be supported by all users the hide your input and echo telnet control codes provide for the support of two functions available in some time sharing systems the hide your input function is really a special case of the echo mode of operation where the server tells the user that the server will echo but the server does not a separate code is used for this func tion since some servers may support this function but may not support the full echo mode of operation this material has not been reviewed for public release and is intended only for use with the arpa network it should not be quoted or cited in any publication not related to the arpa network page the hide your input and echo modes of operation are disabled with the no echo control ascii control codes could have been chosen for these functions but it was decided that the nvt ascii control codes should only be specified for commonly used functions to indicate the number of characters for which the printing should be suppressed the hide your input telnet control could be rede fined to include a byte following the hide your input control to indicate the number of characters for which the printing should be concealed the no echo control would still be sent so that systems with the print suppress feature would not have to count characters data types the protocol should allow a server to support users with character codes other than ascii e g ebcdic the definition of an alter nate character code should include the definition of the telnet control codes an ebcdic code has been proposed in rfc and has been implemented on the lincoln laboratory if it is desired to allow one to return to the network standard ascii code the non ascii code should contain a code to indicate return to ascii reverse break the code for break is defined as a th ascii data code it is usually transmitted from a user s network virtual terminal to a server when a corresponding key break key or attention key is typed on the telnet terminal and is interpreted by serving systems as that special key since a common function of this key is to interrupt a running process the server must be alerted to the fact that this code has been transmitted no matter when it is sent thus the telnet sync telnet data mark together with a network interrupt on the telnet send socket must also be trans mitted to cause the serving process to examine the received charac ters the ascii control code eot octal could have been chosen for the break function but his code is not interpreted by all systems thus it was decided that an nvt telnet control code should be used for this purpose the use of the break code from server to user telnet has not previously been defined and thus could be used to solve the following problems which occur with line at a time and half duplex systems line at a time systems do not output characters to the terminal a character at a time but instead wait until a line is ready for output if a cr lf sequence telnet protocol for end of line is received it is interpreted as an end of line and the characters received are output if characters are received which do not end page with cr lf the user telnet does not know whether or not other characters will follow which are part of the current line thus the characters received thus far must be output without a cr lf new line if an end of message code were transmitted the user telnet would know whether or not other characters would be received for output the user telnet would then print characters either when the telnet break control is received or when the cr lf newline sequence is received if the user telnet is being run from a half duplex terminal the terminal cannot receive input and type output at the same time thus if output is received while the terminal is being used for input the telnet program must either buffer the received characters or abort the input mode of operation to write out the received charac ters if characters received are written out as they are received the terminal operation would be very similar to a full duplex terminal this mode of operation requires that the terminal have a reverse break capability to allow the input mode to be aborted by program control in some systems it is only desirable to abort the input mode of operation when a complete line is ready for output if a string of characters received does not end with an end of line code the characters received will not be output until after the input line is entered i e the mode of operation changed from input to output if an end of message code were transmitted the user telnet could abort the input mode of operation even though the end of line code was not received in systems which do not support the reverse break feature or if the terminal does not have this feature it is not possible to abort an input mode of operation in order to output received characters in this case the systems can operate in either of two modes a un locked keyboard or b locked keyboard mode in an unlocked keyboard system received characters are not output until the user completes an input line an input line is completed when the end of line code is entered this might be a cr a lf or a nl code after received characters if any are output the input modes is re entered to receive output the user must enter an input line possibly a null line if the user is waiting for output he must repeatedly enter a line until the output has been received and typed since an input line must be entered just to receive output it is desirable to define an input line which does not result in anything being sent to the serving system if a null line a line consisting of just the end of line code is chosen for this purpose some other input line must be defined to cause a null line to be transmitted in a locked keyboard system the input mode is not immediately page re entered after an input line is entered it is re entered only after a defined prompt is received the prompt can be defined to be the reception of any character or can be defined to be a specific charac ter code if a specific code is chosen the serving site must send this code whenever the terminal should be put into input mode if an end of message code were transmitted this code could be inter preted to be the input prompt code in summary three situations have been described where an end of message code would be desirable a to indicate when a line which does not end with cr lf should be output for line at a time systems b to indicate that the input mode in half duplex operation should be aborted so that received characters can be output c as a prompt character to cause the input mode to be entered for locked keyboard half duplex systems the ascii telnet control code for break reverse break could be interpreted as an end of message code when sent from server to user this rfc was put into machine readable form for entry into the online rfc archives by bbn corp under the direction of alex mckenzie page
