network working group l peter deutsch parc maxc request for comments september nic cross country network bandwidth the following computation of cross country network bandwidth was contributed by butler lampson of parc consider what happens when a tip user on the west coast connected to a full duplex host on the east coast strikes a key on his terminal the tip sends a one character message packet the destination imp sends a rfnm packet the destination host sends an allocate this seems to be the strategy used by tenex hosts at least packet thc tip sends a rfnm for the allocate packet the same sequence repeats itself with roles interchanged for the echo character packets this constitutes packets or ooo bits in each direction the current cross country transmission capability of the arpanet is okb phone lines ergo it can only support such characters per second it may be that rfnms are transmitted between imps more efficiently at best this can only double the network capacity this computation may help explain why cross country tip users e g the substantial west coast community of bbn tenex users experience such bad echo response at least in bursts the network itself may be experiencing momentary peak loads if this argument is correct the proposed remote echoing facilities of the new telnet protocol could have a major effect on network operation
