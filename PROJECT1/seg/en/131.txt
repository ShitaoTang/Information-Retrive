 network working group steve bunch rfc ill ants nic march illinois reply to maxwell s request for graphics information nic document this is a reply to craig maxwell s ucla nmc request for graphics information of further details can be obtained by contacting me directly to date our work in graphics has been primarily centered about support for several applications groups to make the generation of beam oriented graphics as painless as possible for these groups our policy for supporting this type of graphics has been to emulate as closely as possible the calcomp plotter support package on the host machine but with ngp output presently before the resulting ngp can be sent to some of our peripherals e g gould it must be converted to device specifics with the advent of ants mark ii and a pdp all conversions will be handled locally so all graphics flowing into our system will be ngp we find this approach very labor saving even at the present slightly kludgey level we also have some grey scale work taking place on our gould and imlac one group is processing satellite pictures on illiac and will soon need grey scale output another is producing natural resource maps and a third is generating holograms no standardization plans have been made for grey scale work but if an acceptable standard is established we will most likely use it a small group including myself is currently planning an interactive graphics system the system will use multiple hosts possibly using a remote e s machine for rotation scaling etc we have a number of large hurdles that have to be jumped before we can do anything though several of these are not graphics specific such as process controlled ftp inter process coordination among hosts and others we had intended to let efficiency dictate the format of intermediate results shipped via the net with standardization being applied where it is helpful for minimizing effort since the system will be highly interactive and will also manipulate grey scale data we will need a higher level of graphics protocol to handle the user interface a proto prototype system is being used now to do some simple manipulations of meteorological data e g contouring d plotting bunch page rfc reply to request for graphics information march with an imlac passively displaying the ngp pictures created soon i hope to finish an imlac program that will handle some interaction with the mouse keyset i have decided to implement the following outgoing commands move beam to mouse position draw from last to present beam position text at present beam position undo the last command to facilitate freehand drawing and backspacing in text other commands may be implemented as needed to do what people want to do at least until an adequate interaction standard comes along note that there is implicit in the undo command the assumption that the other end of the line possesses a certain amount of memory and intelligence two possible philosophies for standardizing interaction are that all nodes generators or users of data understand some set of commands and possess at least a certain amount of intelligence and a distinction is made between displays and computers quotes because the line is fuzzy i favor the first for its generality but i suggest that the lowest level of interactive graphics might want to use the second for ease of implementation with unintelligent devices e g computek s i do not mean to imply in that the actual computer would not have a larger vocabulary than the actual display this is inevitable with higher level capabilities in the protocol since we have almost no local computing power for applications work all our graphics computation is done remotely our work has been primarily at ucsd b usc isi tenex and ucla ccn because we do our work at scattered sites and are basically economic of labor pronounced lazy we have a lot to gain by standards and will be glad to cooperate as much as possible with standardization efforts steve bunch this rfc was put into machine readable form for entry into the online rfc archives by alex mckenzie with support from gte formerly bbn corp bunch page
