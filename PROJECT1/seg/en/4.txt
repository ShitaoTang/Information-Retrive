 network working group b thomas request for comments bbn tenex nic august tenex load averages for july this rfc presents utilization data for the bbn and isi tenex systems which may be of interest to the network community the graph on page summarizes the load at the bbn tenex and usc isi hosts during the work week for the month of july the weekday hourly load average for each site is plotted versus the time of day the time of day is eastern daylight time interpreting data such as this is tricky business however it is difficult to resist making the following observations the shapes of the bbn and isi curves are approximately the same furthermore there is no skew between the curves this suggests that the user populations for the two systems have similar working habits and are acclimated to the same time zone the significant features of both curves appear to be strongly correlated with normal events in the day of a user living on east coast time suggesting that the load at both sites is influenced most strongly by such users a the load begins to increase between a m edt as users begin their daily computing b it dips between a m edt smoothed to a smaller rate of increase in the isi curve as users take their coffee break c the load peaks sharply between p m edt as users return from lunch to resume their computing d it decreases as the afternoon continues and as users go home from work e it reaches a local minimum between p m edt minimum not present in isi curve when most people eat dinner f it increases to an evening peak between p m edt as some users come back from dinner and after dinner activities to resume their computing thomas page rfc tenex load averages for july august the curve for isi is smoother than the one for bbn the coffee break dip appears only as a decrease in slope the dinner break and evening peak are completely smoothed out this smoothing is probably due to the influence of the west coast users of the isi machine during july the bbn system was more heavily loaded than the isi system since the data collected did not include the number of active jobs it is not possible to determine from the data whether bbn had more users or just more demanding users the data presented on the graph is available as a side effect of the rsexec system the server programs for the rsexec system rsser programs communicate regularly with one another exchanging status information the rsser program at each site maintains a dynamic data base of the information it collects from the rsser programs at other sites the netload command of the tenex exec as well as many rsexec commands makes use of information in that database the raw data for bbn and isi load curves as well as data for the other tenex sites that run rsser was collected by a program which creates daily load information files by periodically every minutes reading load average data from the data base maintained by rsser the monthly summary was produced by a program that analyzes daily data files the following graph is also available in ps and pdf format thomas page rfc tenex load averages for july august weekday hourly load averages july b bbn tenex i isi tenex b b load avg b i i b i b b b i i i b i b b i i i b b i i b i b b i b i i i b b i i b b am am pm pm midnight noon midnight time of day eastern daylight time thomas page rfc tenex load averages for july august endnotes the tenex load average is a measure of cpu demand the load average is an average of the number of runable processes over a given time period for example an hourly load average of would mean that for a single cpu system at any time during that hour one could expect to see process running and others ready to run i e not blocked for i o waiting for the cpu the data for bbn and isi was chosen for presentation in this rfc because the bbn and isi tenexs are two of the major time sharing service hosts on the network this rfc was put into machine readable form for entry into the online rfc archives by jim larson thomas page
