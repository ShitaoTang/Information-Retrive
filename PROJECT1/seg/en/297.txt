 network working group d liddle request for comments owens illinois inc nic january ds display system introduction this document describes a proposed modular graphic alphanumeric display system containing a x line line per inch plasma display memory panel and a mini processor it is intended to combine the advantages of display memory and local processing power to operate in three general modes as follows as an intelligent terminal operating on data received from the network or a local host to perform text editing picture processing etc as a passive terminal in which the mini processor translates existing display lists command strings and data structure for storage tube terminals or other devices into the proper form to operate the plasma display in particular a software module for simulation of the ards a is provided as an offline system where the processor is operated as a stand along mini computer for debugging editing and general display work the ds consists of a display module a processor module and keyboard see figure the display model is a digivue display memory unit model produced by owens illinois inc containing the plasma panel and associated drive circuitry the processor module was specially designed and built for the ds application by the raytheon company a modem is enclosed in the processor module and is described in later sections an alternative rs interface is also available for connection to a tip or teletype compatible system figure ds display system in addition to the display module and the processor the ds has a modem for data transmission and ascii keyboard and an i interface to support numerous external devices the mechanical design of the ds emphasizes flexibility so that both the keyboard and display module can be oriented independently of the processor module liddle page rfc ds display system january software will be supplied with the ds for such functions as text editing vector generation data management and various i routines the ds is intended principally to operate as an online terminal the offline mode is used for programming and data preparing chores which do not require access to the host computer in describing system operation therefore offline operations are simply a subset of online operations in which the only i functions are local the i operations are accomplished by direct input output instructions a special feature of the series machines developed at the raytheon company a single instruction din for input dot for output enables the external device addressed by the instruction to accept the data presently in the accumulator dot or to transmit data to the accumulator din over the data buss the plasma display x and y address registers are seen as output devices by the processor the other basic output device is the modem the keyboard and input modem are the basic input devices in addition to the optional cassette tape system for program loading these devices and the interfacing of other peripherals are described in later sections figure is a block diagram of the basic ds configurations emphasizing the i structure the principal role of the processor module is in the restructuring of input data to an appropriate output form either from modem to display computer to operator or keyboard to modem operator to computer such processing consists of handling communication chores figure us i configuration string and stack manipulation character suppression or translation vector construction from endpoint data or character encoded line drawing commands and data stream protocol and management so that the input output character stream over the modem or channel remains compatible with the host computer while the keyboard inputs and display outputs are being effectively and efficiently handled the real significance of the ds as a new display terminal stems from its use of the plasma display memory unit because of its inherent memory and selective erase capability it can be addressed asynchronously requires no special refresh or access to buffer memory and is indistinguishable from any other output medium such as tape etc seen from the operator s point of view it has very desirable human factors such as high contrast and crisp line dimensions no jitter flicker or distortion and the capability for rear projection of pictorial or tabular data from slides or microfiche for example liddle page rfc ds display system january both the display module and the processor are described in details in subsequent sections as well as the mechanical construction communication interfaces keyboard and the system software section display module the ds display module is an owens illinois digivue display memory unit model it contains the plasma panel drive electronics and display logic these three assemblies are described in the following paragraphs panel the digivue display panel or plasma panel is a matrix device it is constructed from two pieces of plate glass upon which very fine gold electrode lines are deposited these electrodes are then completely covered by a dielectric film these two plates are then sealed together with a gap of a few thousandths of an inch between them and with their electrode patterns orthogonally oriented this sandwich is then baked out and pumped down to high vacuum backfilled with a gas mixture consisting largely of neon and sealed off the addition of flexible ribbon cable connectors completes the fabrication of the panel the device is fat roughly thick and virtually transparent the panel is operated in such a way that any location i e any x y intersection may be individually turned on or off as a source of visible light further such a location has a memory and is sustained in the on or off state until a new selection signal changes it an ac voltage is applied between all x and all y electrodes in parallel so that an ac signal less than the breakdown potential is applied across the gas at all times this is called the sustaining voltage vs when a single x y point is to be addressed a voltage pulse vp is applied to the appropriate x and y lines such that the total addressing voltage at their intersection is given by v add vs vp which exceeds the breakdown potential of the gas initiation a discharge since the electrodes are covered by a dielectric no discharge current can flow in the external circuit rather the ions and electrons produced by the discharge are carried by the applied field and are deposited as stored charge on the dielectric surfaces until liddle page rfc ds display system january the resultant net field is nearly zero quenching the discharge after about one microsecond as the ac sustaining voltage changes polarity however this stored charge constitutes a bias voltage adding to the sustaining signal and producing a new discharge which results in stored charge causing another discharge on the next half cycle etc thus once addressed a single x y location continues to produce a discharge twice in every sustainer period or about thousand times per second naturally this appears as a continuous glow to the eye a sustained location may be turned off by addressing in such a way that the stored charge is allowed to return to zero thus a location or cell may be turned on or off in a bistable random access manner the plasma display has a number of extremely useful visual characteristics its transparency permits the use of rear projected data from microfilm color slides maps forms etc to be mixed with the dynamic computer generated data to be displayed characters plots graphics etc in addition to the high brightness of the gas discharge the contrast ration is extremely nigh the panel used in the model has x lines at lines per inch this high resolution and large size allows highly readable characters and graphics to be mixed without distortion or jitter of the data dot matrix characters are especially attractive since the dots of the discharge sites have very clean crisp dimensions a significant system characteristic of the plasma display matrix is its random access memory property unlike storage tube displays it may be selectively erased as well as written changing a single point curve or character without altering the contents of other locations on the panel large quantities of text time histories of measured data or complex memory this allows more efficient use of the processor and simpler data management within computer memory the panel used in the ds application will have an active area of x inches containing x lines there will be an additional line peripheral border around the addressable area to provide conditioning of the discharge sites the back of the panel will be frosted with an optically diffusing surface suitable for the projection of optical images a circularly polarizing neutral density filter with anti glare coating will be provided on the front of the display the brightness and contrast will be sufficient for use in a normal lighted laboratory area liddle page rfc ds display system january drive electronics the drive electronics for the display module will be the standard owens illinois circuits requri ed to operate a x line panel as part of our model standard display unit they consist of a sustaining generator which maintains cells once addressed in the appropriate state on or off after removal of the addressing signal and pulse forming circuits for the generation and appropriate mixing of addressing pulses at the selected panel sites the sustainer will operate with a basic period of microseconds with a peak voltage of approximately volts exact voltage levels frequency and waveshape are adjusted for optimal performance subject to power supply constraints and data rate requirements the address circuits are multiplexed to reduce the number of active circuits required and employ a non linear mixing scheme for line selection a pulse of volts is applied with the proper time phase to achieve writing and erasing the pulse is disabled in all but the selected line pair provision is also made for bulk erasure in which the entire panel is erased in two sustainer periods a power supply of high density design will provide the necessary sustaining addressing and logical level voltages the design will employ high frequency invertors and switching regulation for maximum efficiency and reduced size it requires about watts and will be housed inside the processor module display logic the logic included in the display module provides the timing and control required for the sustaining generator and the address pulses and also provides the logic level interface to the processor module the interface is ttl compatible it contains nine bit address ports x x and y y which not legible in absolute binary code the x y intersection which is to be addressed these addresses are accepted when given a write command or an erase command by the control lines w or e respectively these inputs must all be held steady until acceptance of the data and completion of the operation has been indicated by the status line a logic level output from the display unit ad additional control line b is used in conjunction with the h line to cause a bulk erasure of the entire screen liddle page rfc ds display system january the model display unit proposed in this document is of the serial address type and thus can write or erase a single point each u seconds this permits vectors to be drawn at more than inches second characters in a x dot matrix can be written at a rate of about characters per second a parallel address type display unit is presently being developed at owens illinois this module when available will be compatible with the ds system with no modification to the processor required this display will address lines in parallel which will allow more than characters per second to be displayed or a complete page to be generated in seconds section processor module the processor is a minicomputer figure that accepts ascii encoded commands and generates outputs to control the writing of information by the display module the processor performs the functions of storing information data and instructions and regulating the flow of information between the terminal s keyboard modems display module and program loading device figure in a typical operation the processor calls up input commands from the modem and the keyboard and generates instructions to the display module driver circuitry to produce the required characters vectors or editing programs instructions and data are stored in bit words arithmetic functions are performed in s complement form the basic machine cycle time is microseconds the major functional units of the processor are figures o memory o memory address register o program counter o instruction register o accumulator o instruction processing synchronizer o terminal i o circuitry these units are briefly described next liddle page rfc ds display system january memory an operational memory of bit words plus bootstrap memory of bit words are provided the word memory is a random address memory ram and is used to store the character generator the vector generator and the editing programs needed to provide the specific operational requirements of the terminal using the ram type memory provides the flexibility figure processor data flow figure instruction processor synchronizer to alter instruction routines and to tailor the terminal for the application since the terminal uses ram an operational program loading device a magnetic tape cassette read write recorder is proposed so that the operational program can be loaded when the terminal is turned on the ram size is sufficient to permit storage of characters a vector generation routine and an instruction set the bootstrap memory is provided for storing a terminal start up program that puts the terminal in a state for reading instruction data into its operational memory from external sources read only memory rom devices are used for the bootstrap memory both the ram and the rom memories are made up entirely of mos memory address register the memory address register ma is a twelve bit register that can be loaded with the program counter or the address portion of the memory data program counter the program counter pc is a bit counter register that can be loaded with the address portion of the instruction register instruction register the instruction register ir is a bit register of which bits contain the instruction and bits the data associated with the instruction this can be loaded with a bit memory word liddle page rfc ds display system january accumulator ac the accumulator ac is a bit shift register that can be loaded with the contents of the program counter the data inputs or the arithmetic unit instruction processing synchronizer ips the instruction processing synchronizer controls the timing and data flow in the processor clocked by its own oscillator the ips calls up instructions from the memory which then dictates the sequence to be followed terminal i o circuitry the processor communicates with the other elements of the terminal either directly on the i o bus or via one of three device controllers the controllers are required to make the i o devices compatible with the processor separate controllers are provided for keyboard display module and serial i o devices the i o bus includes o parallel input data lines o parallel output data lines o lines for selecting the i o device to communicate with the processor o lines for specifying the function to be performed o sense lines for monitoring the status of each i o device o strobe lines to initiate the transfer of data to and from the i o devices o system clock line each of these lines are available at the i o bus connector the lines required by each controller varies with the function performed by the controller figure three ports are provided with the serial i o channel controller two asynchronous and one synchronous the latter is for use with an optional cassette tape recorder that can be either supplied as an option with the terminal or purchased at a later date the two asynchronous ports are for interface with a liddle page rfc ds display system january teletypewriter modem not supplied and a telephone modem that is supplied with the terminal direct connection with a data processing machine ca be accomplished at the i o bus connector the processor provides a single level interrupt that causes the processor to transfer control to a designated sub program while automatically storing the contents of all appropriate registers and the return linkage the mask and unmask instructions cause the interrupt line to be gated according to the state of an inhibit flip flop the last instruction interrupt return restores the program counter accumulator and overflow indicator to the condition existing at the time of interrupting software the desired terminal operations that is the logical capabilities of the display terminal will be implemented in software this approach provides a degree of flexibility and versatility to the terminal s editing and display writing capability in the latter area the generation and display of characters symbols and graphics are limited in variety only by the resolution dots per inch and the size x of the display screen the flexible nature of this approach is enhanced by the expandability of the memory to k k optional the software is divided into two segments servicing routines for the input modem the output modem the keyboard and the display module and specific function routines for line generation editing point generation and character generation typical software processing starts with the program in an idle loop checking the input sense line when a bit is ready in the modem the sense line goes true the processor skips and the program inputs the bit the sense line resets the program counts the bit saves it and returns to an idle loop waiting for subsequent bits as each bit is input it is stored in proper sequence when a word is entirely memory it is moved to another memory location where it can be decoded the program resets the input counts for the next word and transfers to the task routine which analyzes the command and determines which segment of the program is to perform the function for this case assume that the program was instructed to plot a character the program computes a table from the value of the character code the table contains a compacted image of the dots representing the character the image is unpacked from the table into a temporary hold area then starting at the top left corner the program outputs the coordinates and the one or zero value of the image the next point is output in the next lower y position the liddle page rfc ds display system january process is repeated until bits have outputted one column the program resets the y coordinate to the original y and increments the x the next column is output the same as the first when nine columns have been output the program returns to the idle loop instruction description instructions and data are in the form of bit words arithmetic functions are performed in s complement form the following word formats are applicable instruction i op address address data i address data s data the instruction format provides bit to indicate indirect addressing bits for the operations code oop and bits for the address the address data format contains bits of address and bit for indicating indirect addressing the data word format includes sign bit and bits for data logical control of data flow in the display processor is centered about the accumulator with the majority of the operations involving it or the sensing of data conditions involving the accumulator the processor operations represent types of instructions o data movement through the accumulator o logical operations on accumulator contents o condition checking o input output o jump control o indexing each of these instruction types are briefly discussed next refer to appendix i for a complete description of the instruction set liddle page rfc ds display system january data movement instructions cla lda add stc these four instructions enable the accumulator to be cleared or to be loaded with data effect the addition of a word to the accumulator s contents and enable the accumulator contents to be stored in memory logical operations and cmp ral sal these four instructions enable a word in memory to be logically anded to the accumulator permit the s complement of the accumulator s contents to be formed enable a left rotation of the accumulator contents and permit a left shift of the accumulator s contents to be made condition checking saz snz sac sna sno these five instructions allow for various condition checks saz and snz permit the accumulator to be checked for zero or non zero contents sag and sna enable any bit position in the accumulator to be checked for a or setting sno provides a check for accumulator overflow input output ss din dot the ss instruction provides a means of determining whether devices which interface with the processor e g modem display module are ready for data transfers actual transfer of data occurs through the accumulator one word at a time din causes one bit word to be transferred from an external device to the accumulator dot indicates the transfer of one bit word from the accumulator to an external device the particular device din or dot address is indicated by the value in the device address field of the instruction the instructions enable controller i o with a variety of peripheral units jump control jmp jsr these instructions provide the means for altering the flow of program logic jmp is an unconditional transfer of control to a designated memory location jsr provides a subroutine capability to the program the execution of a jsr instruction involves saving the return address to the jump at a designated location by designating the store for the return address as not being in line with executed code the program which is in execution can be held in read only memory indexing ias liddle page rfc ds display system january these instructions provide an indexing facility to the order code the indexing occurs in the memory location specified in the address field of the ias instruction thus multiple indexing is possible the above instruction types provide a fundamental but general programming capability a basic symbolic assembly language has been built about this instruction set and is used to write programs which do character assembler program the assembler is written in fortran language modem the display terminal is supplied with a modem for interfacing the i o controller with a telephone line the modem operates asynchronously through one of the three i o controller ports figure it is an fsk unit that operates at data rates from to bps in a four wire full duplex mode and from to bps in a half duplex mode in the four wire full duplex mode both the local and remote modem operate fully independently a data transfer sequence may be originated from either model at any time by activating the request to send signal the data transfer sequence is terminated by dropping the rts signal at the originating modem in the half duplex mode the modem operates with any data format selection between transmit and receive modem identity is determined by the status of the request to send signal from the processor the modem may be used over a dial up network using the half duplex mode operation in this manner requires the use of the november data access arrangement number f supplied by the bell system in this operating mode a data call is originated by the phone set associated with the data access arrangement at the remote location the call is manually answered and the data key on the phone se is placed in the data position keyboard a multimode keyboard with standard ascii character to key assignments is proposed the keyboard includes codes for upper and lower case alphanumerics and special function keys and codes for editing operations figure ds i o data lines section mechanical considerations the ds consists of
