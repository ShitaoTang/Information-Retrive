 network working group j bouknight request for comments j madden nic g grossman university of illinois october connection by name user oriented protocol i introduction shortly after the first of the year the center for advanced computation cac at the university of illinois will begin to use the facilities of the arpa network we are the first of a small class of network nodes whose chief characteristic is that the node is a port to the network only all computational power for these nodes will be taken from other nodes on the network illiac iv for example an important characteristic of most of the users at our center is a lack of sophistication about data communication techniques and practices the user will eventually be in the majority of those using the network from all nodes but the problem is ours almost from the start in our discussions with our prospective users of the network as we designed our port facility we found that the greatest confusion and consternation arose over having to deal with network protocol at the nitty gritty level of sockets links etc while most of them have been acclimated to computer systems at the file and device by name level where the software system handles details here on the current version of the network the user handles all details thus we were compelled to seek a user level interface to network protocol where all user protocol is handled symbolically with system procedures making the translation into host to host protocol currently connections are established by exchange of known socket numbers for the four loose ends of the connection this requires either that the user or process always know all socket numbers he will use at his or other installations or that his ncp and or related software remember them for him allowing him to reference them symbolically we propose a more general solution to the telephone book approach of obtaining socket numbers for user or processes only the host at each site knows its socket number space at any given instant in time as well as the status of the user or process to which a socket number bouknight et al page rfc connection by name user oriented protocol october assigned additionally most permanently assigned devices and or processes are known by standard mnemonic labels such as dsk disk lp line printer cr card reader teco pdp text editor etc in most systems all other communications are done through files or pseudo files known only to the user by their names and not by their internal mechanism in other words most intrasystem communication at the user level is by symbolic reference to both devices and process we propose facilities by extension of the current protocol that will allow users to use the network on a connection by name basis as they already do in their host system in the remainder of this paper we will present the suggested extensions to the current protocol and give an example of its usage in a dialogue between a user at cac controlling two processes one at utah and one at paoli illiac iv construction site ii proposed extensions to protocol let us define a class of syntax elements for use in our proposed extensions to the protocol this syntax is expressed in the metalanguage of the algol report a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z a standard set of should be established to reference line printers card readers etc those hard peripherals with fixed processing tasks a beginning set of might be lp line printer cr card reader cp card punch ptr paper tape recorder ptp paper tape punch mt magnetic tape dsk disk tty teletype compatible terminal bouknight et al page rfc connection by name user oriented protocol october the format of is that of the responding host for the current discussion future discussions about foreign user usage of host facilities may result in a standard format for the entire network most systems can identify files by one plus the others such as the burroughs b use multifile identifiers where many may be used in the the set of is that proposed in rfc i e ascii the proposed extensions involve a request for information and several variants of a response to the request a request for socket number for this label the rfsnl is sent on the control link to the destination host requesting the socket number of the attached b acknowledgement of request upon receipt of an the destination host returns one of three responses the first response returns the requested socket number and signifies that the user device or process exists the second response returns the requested socket number but signifies that the user device or process is not currently available for connection the last response signifies that no such user device or process exists c discussion the above extensions to the protocol are intended to enhance user acclimation to network usage the element of strangeness is subdued and in fact for user of the b erased attached to this rfc is an appendix containing a preliminary description of the user language of the network port facility being brought up at the cac we now present a sample user session on the cac facility and detail how the protocol is used to establish the proper communication paths bouknight et al page rfc connection by name user oriented protocol october iii example of user dialogue assume a user residing at cac whose site code is urbana his terminal is an alphanumeric crt terminal and we assume solution of code conversion problems for network communications the sample user session will involve the setting up of two processes at two host sites with control from the third host site all operations can be accomplished with the current protocol plus the proposed extensions in addition we also assume that some form of standard user code is in use for all host sites uniquely identifying every network user when he is present output keyed by systems will be underlined comments are offset to the right for legibility all statements about the utah system are purely hypothetical user dialogue comments the user moves to the terminal applies power and types hello the cac system responds for login purposes

instructs its ncp to acknowledge any request for grossman alpha from illiac with the socket number pip will send from as soon as the b ncp tries again to find grossman alpha from utah success occurs and the socket numbers are exchanged with subsequent connection establishment pip completes the task and terminates the connection to the b disk print eoj b acknowledges completion of task to spo save

october syntax and semantics for the terminal user control language for the proposed pdp arpa network terminal system by g r grossman prefatory notes the following document represents a first attempt at providing a control language for the terminal user of the pdp network terminal system this language is deemed sufficiently powerful to provide the user with a minimal facility for attaching to remote host computers over the arpa network initiating processes and routing data flow to local peripheral devices the hardware system as envisioned will comprise a pdp with a least k of core a small disk kilobytes of storage a console teletype and optional card readers line printers dectapes user terminals card punches storage scopes etc the executive system will consist of a basic driver system which will control autonomous processes and interrupt driven device service routines the system will keep tables in core and on the small disk for logging peripheral usage keeping track of connections on the network queuing up of tasks that cannot be immediately performed storing attributes of remote hosts etc since network hosts handle communications in character at a time or message modes and may or may not echo characters over the network the system takes this into account when handling connections to specific hosts if the connection is in message mode minimal line by line editing facility character and line deletion is provided a means for the user to change flag and message transmit characters is provided to prevent incompatibilities which may arise between the pdp and other hosts this document does not describe control card syntax for card reader usage nor does it describe the operator s control language these will be described in later documents character set a b y z

statement link to queue queue semantics the link statement directs the system to set up a connection between the user s unit and a remote host the construct allows the user to specify that if the connection cannot be set up immediately the system is to keep trying if the queue form is used the system will keep trying indefinitely if the queue integer form is used the system will try for integer minutes copy statement copy to network cr tr ss network bouknight et al page rfc connection by name user oriented protocol october cp lp tr ss semantics the directs the system to set up a connection between the and and copy records of information between them if the or form is used for either or the copy process cannot begin until a unit is assigned to the user if the form is used the copy process can likewise not proceed until the system has access to a properly labeled tape if the network form is used a connection to a remote process must be pending the construct has the same meaning as for the with the additional provision that the condition that caused the process to be incomplete may be the lack of a device assignment end statement end semantics the causes the current connection to be terminated user statement user semantics the is used during the log in process to allow the user to identify himself status statement status status semantics the allows the user to interrogate the system as to the status of a device or class of devices bouknight et al page rfc connection by name user oriented protocol october out statement out leave semantics the allows a user to log out of the system if the out form is used all queued process initiated by the user are terminated the leave from does not terminate such pending queued processes so long as these processes do not directly involve the user s terminal to statement to con to semantics the allows the user to send a message to the operator or another logged in user flag statement flag semantics the allows the user to define the character which the system recognizes as preceding a control statement as distinguished from a message to a remote process to which he may be attached the default flag character is back statement back ascii special or control character semantics the allows the user to define the character which in control or message mode causes the system to forget the previous input character the default backspace character is rubout ascii delete statement delete ascii special or control character semantics the allows the user to define the character which in control or message mode causes the system to forget the previous line of input the default delete character is ascii vt control k bouknight et al page rfc connection by name user oriented protocol october transmit statement transmit ascii special or control character semantics the allows the user to define the character which in control or message mode causes the system to begin interpreting the control statement or to transmit the message the default transmit character is carriage return lock statement lock semantics the causes the system to prevent any user or process but the process to which the user is currently attached from sending messages to the user s terminal unlock statement unlock semantics the reverses the action of a previous assign statement assign lp dt cp semantics the causes the system to attempt to assign a device not currently in use to the user the construct has the same meaning as for the label statement label dt semantics the causes the system to write a new label on the dec tape
