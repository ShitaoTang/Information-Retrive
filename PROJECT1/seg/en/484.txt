 network working group jim hansen request for comment center for advanced nic computation category d university of illinois updates rfc october obsoletes none conversion of ngp coordinates to device specific coordinates conversion of ngp coordinates to floating point pdp coordinates was discussed in rfc in general however it is undesirable to convert ngp coordinates to floating point coordinates because real devices require integer addressing to this end a means is described to convert ngp coordi nates to integer coordinates in the range zero to m where m is the maximum address of the device screen on a machine using s complement arithmetic it would not however be difficult to modify this algorithm to operate on machines using one s complement or sign magnitude arithmetic first consider the ngp coordinate format n s fraction i g n where the sign occupies the most significant bit of the coordinate followed by bits of numerical information initial implementation of ngp requires n negative numbers are represented by s complement conversion to device coordinates is accomplished by d s f s where d integer device coordinate s scaling factor typically m f ngp fractional coordinate let us rewrite this as n n d s f s page now factor s into two terms i s q where q is an odd integer and i is an integer when i n n d q f s i n n q f s n the factor f is represented in s complement form simply by extending the sign bit of f into the upper portion of the computer word if q as it would be with many devices it can be ignored if q we may console ourselves that an integer multiply is faster on most machines than a floating point multiply in fact on a pdp this multiply can usually be performed with no access to memory since q is usually small i n we are now left with the factor this can be accomplished with an arithmetic shift left by i n or an arithmetic shift right by n i as is appropriate the offset factor s may now be added using an integer add the procedure for converting ngp coordinates to integer device coordinates is then move coordinate to a register and extend sign integer multiply by q if necessary arithmetic shift left by i n integer add s this procedure would generally be much faster than move coordinate to register and extend sign float fractional coordinate floating point multiply floating point add conversion to fixed point this rfc was put into machine readable form for entry into the online rfc archives by bbn corp under the direction of alex mckenzie page
