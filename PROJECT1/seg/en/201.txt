 network working group ralph alter rfc bbn nic february unknown host numbers in response to a recent minor flurry of confusion it seems worth announcing publicly the fact that new imps are tested almost always on the arpa net here at bbn before delivery to the intended site accordingly sites should not be surprised to receive rfcs or at least rsts from imps or hosts they thought didn t exist or at least did not exist yet occasionally imps of some given configuration are tested in a mode where they announce their imp number as different from what it will be when finally installed a variety of reasons may create such a situation the latest such occurrence is that a tip to be installed shortly at etac with imp number replacing the imp now at etac which is number was recently tested here with mcclellan s imp number it couldn t be tested with its own number since the imp currently at etac is using that number the result was rsts from the tip host at imp which is network address octal or hex one site asked if their host tables needed updating the answer is no we fully expect imps tested under these circumstances to be ignored or cls d by some hosts we suggest that host tables where they are thought to be necessary be modified only in response to official notification from bbn via either an rfc or an update to appendix a of bbn report ra jm this rfc was put into machine readable form for entry into the online rfc archives by bbn corp under the direction of alex mckenzie page
