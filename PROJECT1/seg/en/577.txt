 network working group david walden request for comments bbn net nic july references lost message detection as an aside to rfc note that if sending hosts do uniquely identify messages on a given link using the extra four bits and receiving hosts do look at these bits a lost message detection system such as those suggested in rfcs and drops right out of using of the unique message id these extra four bits can be treated as hathaway s scb of rfc providing a element sequence number on a per connection basis a element sequence is sufficient as the imps never allow more than four outstanding messages at one time between a given pair of hosts as hathaway also suggests the element in the sequence can be used to indicate to the receiving host that sequence numbers are not being used to summarize there appear to be three modes of using the message id number under host host protocol the sender can always set the extra four bits to and only transmit one message over a given link at a time this is slow but it allows orderly retransmission of messages without any help from the receiver the receiver can give no help to the sender in this case it doesn t matter whether the sender uses the extra four bits to uniquely identify the messages or not the sender has no method of orderly retransmission although the sender can accurately identify which message was lost if the sender has uniquely identified the messages the sender can have multiple messages outstanding i e rfnms not received on a given link and the receiver can help the sender in this case if the sender uses the extra four bits to uniquely identify the messages in a way which can be synchronized with the receiver e g sequential id numbers the receiver can reliably detect lost messages although it probably will seem insufficient to some if the sender and receiver use synchronized unique message id numbers very reliable retransmission schemes are readily available for instance the sender can retransmit the appropriate messages in response to incomplete transmissions and the receiver can use the unique message ids to sort the retransmitted messages into the proper order walden page rfc lost message detection july with the other received messages alternatively the receiver can discard all messages received out of order and the sender can back up and retransmit a message for which an incomplete transmission was received and all subsequent messages this rfc was put into machine readable form for entry into the online rfc archives by alex mckenzie with walden page
