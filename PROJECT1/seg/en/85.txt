 network working group peggy m karp request for comments mitre nic march related rfcs categories f cbi networking activity at mitre this rfc is in response to tom o sullivan s probe for comments on computer based instruction mitre is currently doing some pre liminary work in the area at the present time limited to use of cai related network resources the most expedient way for me to respond is by attaching excerpts taken from a recent status report prepared for internal mitre use intended for staff not generally familiar with the arpanet comments directed at specific items in tom s attachment will follow in a future rfc we welcome comments on our activities and would like to partici pate in any cbi dialogs that take place page status of ir d task arpa network studies and experiments objectives mitre washington became a node in the arpa computer network in september when a terminal interface message processor tip was installed since that time mitre s use of the network has largely been supported by ir d funds the objectives of the ir d network studies are a to promote the use of the network resources in an operational mode within mitre to increase the computer capabilities available for supporting sponsor s work b to use the arpanet itself as a research tool for conducting computer networking experiments and c to demonstrate the use of arpanet resources to extend the capabilities of existing systems specifically the proposed objectives are to select arpanet resources that can be used to support identified mitre projects and to demonstrate how these resources can be used page to use the arpanet as a research tool to conduct data sharing experiments to study techniques for data handling on a computer network and to demonstrate the feasibility of using remote resources on the arpanet to augment the capabilities of the ticcit system the principle use of the ticcit time shared interactive computer controlled information television system has been for computer assisted instruction cai a ticcit cai system is currently being developed by mitre under a national science foundation nsf grant page approach the ir d network studies and experiments project requires soft ware development on selected arpanet host computers and extensive exercising of network resources the approach taken to fulfill the project objectives involves effort in three areas task area i is designed to build up arpanet usage by mitre task ii involves conducting data sharing experiments on the network utilizing software being built by mitre at several network sites task iii is intended to demonstrate the use of cai related network resources to augment the ticcit cai system the specific activities involved in each task area are discussed below task iii demonstrate extensions to ticcit system capabilities that are possibly by drawing on arpanet resources the structure of the arpanet is such that it is technically possible to combine resources on the network to form a distributed system a first step in this direction would be to use network resources to augment a special purpose system connected at one of the nodes the special purpose system would serve as the vertex of the distributed system dynamically drawing on network resources to perform specific functions page the ticcit cai system is a good candidate for demonstrating the feasibility of the concept of a distributed system however rather than initially connecting ticcit to the network resources on the network will first be used to demonstrate how they could augment the capabilities of ticcit task iii is organized as three subtasks to demonstrate that the range of curriculum material can be extended to demonstrate that the ticcit cai system can be supplemented with specialized cai systems that use ai techniques and to demonstrate that ticcit system resources and capabilities can be augmented by using computing and storage resources available on the network a demonstrate that the range of curriculum material can be extended the range of curriculum material offered by the ticcit cai system can be extended by using network resources two areas that were selected for the demonstration are mathematics and computer science the culler fried on line graphics oriented system available on the ibm at the university of california at santa barbara ucsb was selected for use in mathematics courses a collection of diverse systems and languages will be selected to demonstrate how they can be incorporated in a computer science curriculum the following tasks are necessary for demonstrating that the range of curriculum material can be extended learn the use and structure of the culler fried system use the culler fried system over the network using an page imlac graphics display terminal design sample courses for demonstration of the use of the culler fried system in a mathematics curriculum develop software to incorporate the use of the culler fried system in the sample courses and demonstrate prepare a sample computer science curriculum and demonstrate how the wide range of systems on the network can be utilized in a typical computer science curriculum determine and document the technical specifications required for a ticcit cai system interface b demonstrate that the ticcit cai system can be supplemented with specialized cai systems that use ai techniques there are two network resources utilizing ai techniques that have been applied to computer assisted instruction tasks scholar and logo scholar is a mixed initiative rather than a frame oriented cai system logo is a lisp based programming language designed to study whether notions and skills of formal reasoning and problem solving can be taught we will investigate if these systems can be used to supple ment the ticcit system and if possible will demonstrate their use the following tasks are required investigate the use of scholar on the tenex system at bbn over the network investigate the use of logo and the turtle over the network from the pdp at mit ai and or from tenex at bbn demonstrate the use of the systems over the network page determine and document the requirements for an interface with the ticcit system c demonstrate that ticcit system resources and capabilities can be augmented by using computing and storage resources available on the network it should be possible for the ticcit cai system to substantially in crease its capacity by using large data storage devices on the arpanet for storing student records and curriculum and by using some host computer to run complex statistical analysis programs to analyze and evaluate student progress and course content in order to demonstrate that such a scheme is possible the following tasks are necessary determine format and requirements for curriculum material and student records develop a method to store and retrieve data on a demand basis select a host on the network and develop software for a demonstration determine and document requirements for an interface with the ticcit system progress of work in this section the progress of the work associated with each task is presented both achievements and problems encountered are discussed the manpower expended thus far for each subtask is given in graphic form together with a proposed schedule for completing page the work task iii demonstrate extensions to ticcit system capabilities that are possible by drawing on arpanet resources many of the resources on the arpanet were designed as stand alone systems not intended for use over the network nor for facile interfacing with other systems thus we have found that more work than initially was estimated is needed to use the selected cai related systems over the network therefore we plan to fulfill the goals of each subtask by demonstrating the use of selected resources over the network but will not attempt to interconnect the systems in any fashion during fy a proposal to investigate the notion of a distributed cai system using arpanet resources is under preparation the status of our progress in using cai related resources over the network is presented below a demonstrate that the range of curriculum material can be extended the culler fried c f on line graphics oriented system at ucsb was selected to demonstrate its use in mathematics curriculum the system has been used successfully in a variety of courses at ucsb including chemistry mathematics and economics the culler fried system s normal mode of operation is with two keyboards and a tektronics graphics display device the keys on the second keyboard are function keys for example by pressing a single key the user can initiate complex actions such as displaying a plot page of a convolution function the system can also be used to provide online access to the system to remotely control the execution of programs the latter service is currently available on the network through telnet access to the system was made possible by defining a mapping from ascii characters sent as the network virtual terminal to characters expected by the ols thus it is often necessary to type a sequence of characters on a tty type device to invoke the action of a single function key under the current implementation graphics output to the network is suppressed we plan to demonstrate the use of the c f system on an imlac graphics device attached to our tip during the first phase of our implementation we will not simulate the c f function keyboard but will enter our graphics input using the procedures defined for use via telnet for output ucsb agreed to provide a new output processor which will no longer suppress graphics output but will map it into the remote graphics capabilities as provided by imlac figure such a system was implemented in early february but due to the character oriented nature of the imlac device available to us the resolution was unsatisfactory we have now defined a low level graphics protocol ucsb has agreed to send graphics output to us using this protocol we have had to program new processes for the imlac and are now debugging the new programs due to the limited core available on the particular imlac that we are using k bit words which limits the size of internal display lists we will not page be able to plot very complex graphs however the software being developed is general and can be moved to an imlac with larger core capacity we currently send alphanumeric input from a tty or and divert the graphics output to the imlac when we can access the culler fried system for graphics output successfully via the network we plan to modify the imlac programs to permit alpha input from the imlac keyboard we also plan to investi gate the possibility of attaching a function keyboard to the imlac lastly we intend to investigate the use of ticcit display devices with the tip a sample mathematics course will be designed to assist in demonstration of the cai applications of the culler fried system we are currently studying the past uses of the system in a cai mode we have not yet investigated computer science curriculums we plan to get inputs from the acm committee on computer science educa tion and to visit universities in the washington area this activity is scheduled to commence in april b demonstrate that the ticcit cai system can be supplemented with specialized cai systems that use ai techniques the two network resources selected for demonstration are scholar and logo both systems are implemented in lisp and are currently avail able over the network on the tenex system at bbn a version of logo with a display turtle is available on the pdp at mit ai however they do not yet have their ncp implemented and thus are not currently accessible over the network there is also a version of logo on the tenex system at sri ai they also are not currently connected to the page network and we have not investigated their version we used scholar over the network in january with a data base provided by bbn to review the knowledge of a student in the geography of south america the logo system at mit ai is perhaps the most impressive system for use in a demonstration due to the availability of a display turtle the system is currently being used remotely by the bridge school in lexington massachusetts we visited the school and observed a class in session we also attended an undergraduate class in applied math at mit that was learning turtle geometry seymour papert of mit expects the mit ai pdp to be up on the network by the middle of april he has agreed to modify his system to interface with our imlac via the network using the low level graphics protocol that we specified he has developed many courses and games using logo that provide sufficient material for use in demonstrating the system a real turtle may be available in early summer to run from our tip we have used the logo system at bbn via the network since the system is continually being modified dr feurzeig agreed to put a clean version on the rand tenex for our use bbn s logo does not currently have a display turtle however they are willing to imple ment one even without the display turtle courseware that has been developed for teaching mathematics provides sufficient material for us to work from a radio controlled turtle has been designed page at bbn it may be possible to obtain the specifications and have one built at mitre to run from our tip c demonstrate that ticcit system resources and capabilities can be augmented by using computing and storage resources available on the network work has not begun on this subtask however much of the software developed for the data sharing experiments can be used to store and retrieve data on a demand basis we have received preliminary curriculum material from ticcit personnel we expect to interact with them to determine more speci fically the format and requirements for curriculum material and student records this rfc was put into machine readable form for entry into the online rfc archives by bbn corp under the direction of alex mckenzie page references ewig c s
