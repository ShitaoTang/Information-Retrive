 rfc charles irby nic augmentation research center category d i stanford research institute jul graphics implementation and conceptualization at arc overview this document is a brief description of the way in which graphics terminals are conceptualized and used at the augmentation research center all things described are implemented and have been operational for several months although our attention has initially been centered about the display of textual material we are now about to turn our attention toward pictorial displays hopefully much enhanced over our previous line drawing capabilities this document will discuss only those facits of display use which have been implemented and are currently operational namely only those dealing with textual display included is a discussion of the use of multiple file viewing display areas in nls to provide cross file editing capabilities a description of our display and terminal input equipment will be issued as a separate document note rfc includes a functional description of the implementation of the interface to our displays and is a description of the way this interface was extended to include processor displays an imlac pds in this case to our system thus enabling one to use display nls over any of our teletype lines including the network a processor dsplay is a display with processing power which can be controlled by character strings description of the conceptual display implemented at arc the allocatable output unit for our display terminals which include our local terminals and all remote processor displays is page a rectangular display area a program treats this display area much like it would a file which it has opened with write access when requesting the allocation of a display area a program specifies its attributes including where it is to be on the screen the program is returned an identifier which it subsequently uses to manipulate images within the display area and the display area itself each string which the program writes into the display area is also given an identifier which can subsequently be used to move delete replace or change the characteristics of that string the currently implemented characteristics are character size horizontal spacing between characters and font of the characters e g blinking italics intensity etc the position of items in the display area are given relative to the which is the lower left corner of the display area the horizontal coordinate increases to the right and the vertical coordinate increases toward the top in addition to above described manipulation of strings within display areas a program can suppress the display of individual strings within display areas or suppress whole display areas also a program can switch the terminal s state from teletype simulation to display mode and vis versa when in display mode the teletype simulation display area is suppressed and the coordinates of the cursor are input with each character when in teletype simulation mode all user owned display areas are suppressed and the coordinates of the cursor are not input with each character at tenex startup time display areas are allocated for a teletype simulation and a cursor for each local display terminal programs can change the string being displayed as the cursor to give the human feedback as to the programs state within nls the nls subsystem deals only with the cursor and the display areas it has requested from the system for output to the user the display area formatters assumes that the display has k by k addressable points with at upper left several different character sizes and fonts and bit ascii page the display area formatters use format parameters during the format process and post processors to convert the vertual format to one that is acceptable to the device for which the formatting was being done a display area on the screen a page for a printer a microfilm device or a teletype nls allows the user to specify arguments to commands by selecting items from the current display image this is accomplished through the use of a data structure which describes the current display image to map the cursor coordinates which are input with each character into the proper selection multiple text display areas in nls when the user s device is a display nls allows him to subdivide the file viewing display area the one in which he views his file and view and edit across several different files at once following is a discussion of the commands and capabilities associated with this new feature new commands horizontal split splits a file viewing display area horizontally into an upper and lower segment at the selected location moving the image of the original display area to the upper or lower segment depending on whether the cursor is above or below the bugged position when the final command accept is input no display area will be created which is smaller then lines by columns using the character size of the original display area vertical split splits a file viewing display area vertically into a left and right segment at the selected location moving the image of the original display area to the left or right segment depending on whether the cursor is to the left or right of the selected position when the final ca is input no display area will he created which is smaller then lines by columns using the character size of the original display area page move boundary the selected boundary is moved to the new position a boundary will not be moved passed a boundary of a neighbor a boundary is moved for all display areas for which it is a boundary any resulting display area which is smaller than two lines by twenty columns will be deleted character size the current character size of the display area which currently contains the cursor is displayed and the user may type a number for a new character size the final command accept causes the character size to be changed the horizontal and vertical increment are automatically adjusted different display areas may simultaneously have different character sizes clear display area the selected display area is cleared i e the image is erased the return and file return rings are released and the association of a file with that display area is removed the display area itself is not deleted one may freely edit and jump using several display areas the position of the cursor is used to resolve ambiguities for example if one executes a jump command the position of the cursor when the final command accept is entered determines in which display area the new image is to appear also if one changes viewspecs using the leftmost two buttons of the mouse the viewspecs of the display area containing the cursor when the buttons go down are used as the initial values and are displayed in the viewspec area when the buttons are released the display area containing the cursor receives the new viewspecs this rfc was put into machine readable form for entry into the online rfc archives by bbn corp under the direction of alex mckenzie page
