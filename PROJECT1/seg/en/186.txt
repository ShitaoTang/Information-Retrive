 request for comments w conrad categories c harvard nic august improvement of flow control the current give back return scheme seems to put the cart before the horse in that the return command indicates the amount of space the sending host is returning rather than the amount of space it has left after decrementing by the amount specified in the give back command considering the fact that allocation counters at sending and receiving hosts may get out of synchronization and the fact that the receiving host has a preemptive priority in the allocation of its resources it is only logical that the receiving host be able to find out exactly how much of its buffer space a sending host thinks it can claim if the return command is to accurately reflect a sending host s current allocation and if successive give backs are to produce return commands which can be properly interpreted certain race conditions must be avoided a give back must be answered by a return and no more give backs can be issued until that return is received in some sense a return command as here proposed is really a give back reply and perhaps should implemented under that name on the sending side the return command must not be issued as long as a data rfnm is awaited on the link to which the return refers as soon as the net is clear of data messages the return may be sent and data transmission may continue when the rfnm for this message containing the return command is received the current give back command uses fractions and has a format different from the allocate and return commands making processing unnecessarily complicated by adopting the convention that allocations can not be decremented below zero one can safely specify absolute decrements in a format like that of the allocate command if the receiving host s estimate of a suitable decrement is inaccurate no harm is done and the return command in response to the give back provides immediate corrective information page summary proposal advantage return specifies amount provides more pertinent of space left after information and a means decrementing of resynchronization other than closing connection give back must get provide more accurate return in reply and allocation information return must not be by eliminating race sent with data on the conditions link eliminate fractions eliminate messy math from give back and provide symmetry to allocation commands making processing easier this rfc was put into machine readable form for entry into the online rfc archives by gunnar reichert page
