 network working group alex mckenzie request for comments bbn nic september categories d updates none obsoletes none reference rfc comments on mailbox protocol it should be noted that the terminal imp will be unable to directly implement the currently proposed mailbox protocol for the following reasons a the terminal imp is completely incapable of storing incoming messages for later printing or display b the terminal imp is not expected to be able to perform as the server portion of any connection c the terminal imp cannot provide programs for the processing of a variety of types of input streams it currently supports the telnet protocol and is expected to support at least one mode of data transfer protocol in the future it is not likely to support the file transfer protocol furthermore when using the data transfer protocol it will not perform any transformations on the data stream e g interpretation of line printer form control characters translation from one character set to another etc it will be up to the other end of the connection to set up and decode messages based on the terminal type although these limitations preclude terminal imps from participating in the currently proposed mailbox protocol this should not be considered an objection to implementation of the protocol provided that terminal imp installations will be guaranteed the right to rent mailboxes at some larger host site the nic is probably a good candidate with this capability a message destined for a terminal imp user would be shipped to the site of the rented mailbox according to protocol and stored there a terminal imp user could then periodically log in to that page rfc page site under telnet protocol and examine the contents of the mailbox since the examination would be carried out over a telnet connection the host containing the mailbox would automatically perform the necessary transformation of the data before transmitting it to the terminal imp a technically unattractive alternative to this scheme would be to require each terminal imp site to have a printer dedicated to the mailbox function if the mail were then transferred in telnet format we could probably provide a socket connected to the dedicated printer for receipt of mail obviously if this scheme were chosen a terminal imp could accept mail from only one sender at a time and the transmission rate would be limited to the speed of the printer furthermore a single central mailbox printer is likely to provide poor service to terminal imps with widely scattered terminals e g dial in terminals distributed over an area with a mile radius we feel that in addition to other arguments it would be more cost effective to provide storage for rented mailboxes at one site than to provide a special mailbox printer at each terminal imp site amck jm this rfc was put into machine readable form for entry into the online rfc archives by bbn corp under the direction of alex mckenzie page
