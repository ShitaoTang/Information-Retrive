 network working group a mckenzie rfc bbn nic september categories b c i updates none obsoletes our previous verbal comments connecting computers to mlc ports several times we have been asked if computers can be con nected through serial communication lines to ports on the terminal imp s multi line controller mlc related questions about the level of software support provided by the terminal imp to such a connection have also been raised in the past we have said please don t we now say sure but will that really help you the way you think it will connections between computers and imps i e the host interfaces have been assumed to be error free this assumption is justifiable on the basis that the imp and host computers were expected to be either in the same room up to feet of cable or via the distant host option within feet on well controlled shielded cables a connection through common carrier facilities is not comparably free of errors usage of common carrier lines for connecting a terminal to an imp including the assumption of a human at the terminal is a situation in which the typical errors which do occur can be accommodated usage of the same wire with the same typical errors for a computer to computer connection is likely to be a situation in which the errors are unacceptable the present version of the terminal imp does not provide error control either within its hardware or within its software on any ports of the multi line controller further we feel that computer to computer connections over common carrier circuits should employ strong error control such as that page rfc used on the imp imp circuits and that attempts to use minimal error control e g character parity is an undesirable technical choice strong error control with its retransmission scheme not only would imply significant changes in the terminal imp but a non trivial hardware software implementation at the remote computer end of the circuit because the terminal imp has many obligations the share of its bandwidth which can be given to a host coming in over the mlc will be small the command language provided at a port of the multi line controller was designed with terminals and people in mind it provides very few of the capabilities which a computer requires in order to effectively utilize the communication network for example only a single pair of connections can be made from a given terminal tmp port host computers generally desire a larger number of simultaneous connections to other hosts on the network assuming the present host host protocols such a host could not conveniently act as a server if despite these potential difficulties connection of a computer to the network through an mlc port appears to be useful bbn has no objection in fact we would be extremely interested in hearing about actual experience with this type of network connection amck jm this rfc was put into machine readable form for entry into the online rfc archives by bbn corp under the direction of alex mckenzie page
