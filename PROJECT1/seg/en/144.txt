 network working group s crocker request for comments ucla march network meeting epilogue etc the meeting on tuesday march i hosted a network meeting at ucla about people attended including representatives from mit ll bbn harvard sri utah ucsb sdc rand and ucla i presented a modification of the protocol in nwg rfc the modifications are sketchily documented in nwg rfc the main modification is the facility for dynamic reconnection the protocol based on sockets and undistinguished simplex connections is quite different from the previous protocol as documented in nwg rfc the impetus for making such changes came out of the network meeting on december at utah at which time the limitations of a log in requirement and the inability to connect arbitrary processes was seriously challenged accordingly the primary reason for the recent meeting was to sample opinion on the new protocol recollections may vary but it is my opinion that the protocol was widely accepted and that the criticism and discussion fell into two categories questioning the complexity and usefulness of the full protocol especially the need for dynamic reconnection other topics particularly character set translation higher level languages incompatible equipment etc notably lacking was any criticism of the basic concepts of sockets and connections some have since surfaced the following agreements were made by april i would be responsible for publishing an implementable specification along lines presented any interested party would communicate with me at least immediately if he wished to modify the protocol page rfc network meeting epilogue etc march if major modifications come under consideration interested parties would meet again this would happen in two to three weeks jim forgie of lincoln labs tentatively agreed to host a meeting on higher level network languages probably near spring joint time mailing list changes paul rovner of ll is replaced by james forgie mass institute of technology lincoln laboratory c p o box lexington mass telephone at ext professor george mealy is added george mealy rm aitken computation lab harvard university cambridge massachusetts telephone at ext process in all of our writing we have used the term process to mean a program which has an assigned location counter and an address space a program is merely a pattern of bits stored in some file a new process is created only by an already existing process the previous process must execute an atomic operation forc attach etc to cause such a creation processes may either cause their own demise or be terminated by another usually superior process the above definition corresponds to the definition given by vyssotsky et al on pp of structure of the multics supervisor in the fjcc proceedings page rfc network meeting epilogue etc march because a process may create another process and because in general the two processes are indistinguishable when viewed externally i know of no reasonable way for two processes to request connection directly with each other the function of sockets is to provide a standard interface between processes the days after in the time since the meeting i have had conversations with steve wolfe ucla ccn bill crowther bbn and john heafner and erick harslem rand wolf s comments will appear as nwg rfc and fall into a class i will comment on below crowther submitted the following a brief description of two ideas for simplifying the host protocol described at the march meeting these ideas have not been carefully worked out idea to reconnect a ncp wanting to reconnect tells each of his neighbors i want to reconnect they wait until there are no messages in transit and respond ok he then says reconnect as follows and they do it in the rare condition the ncp gets back an i want to reconnect instead of an ok then one must go and one must stop so treat a reconnect from a higher host user etc as an ok and from a lower as a no wait until i reconnect you and do the connection idea decouple connections and links still establish connections but use any handy link for the messages don t send another message on a connection until a frnm comes back include source and destination socket numbers in the packet to reconnect say to each of neighbors please reconnect me as follows hold onto the connect for a short time seconds and send both packets and connection messages along toward their destinations i haven t worked out how to keep the in transit messages in order but probably everything works if you don t send out a reconnect when rfnm s are pending page rfc network meeting epilogue etc march bill s first idea does not seem to me to be either decisively better or after some thought very different and i am considering it i have no strong feelings about it yet but i am trying to develop some bill s second idea seems contrary to my conception of the role of links an argument in favor of decoupling connections and links that the number of connections between two hosts might want to exceed and that even if not it is sounder practice to isolate dependancies in design on the other hand the newly provided cease on link facility page of the soon to be released bbn report revised febuary becomes useless bill who just put the feature in doesn t care another objection is that it seems intuitively bad to waste the possibility of using the link field to carry information note the conflict of gut level feelings in a conversation with john haefner and eric harslem of rand the pointed out that the current protocol makes no provision for error detection and reporting status testing and reporting and expansion and experimentation error detection and status testing will require some extended discussion to see what is useful and i expect that such discussion will take place while implementation proceeds leaving room for protocol expansion and experimentation however is best done now i suggest that two areas for expansion be reserved one is that only a fraction of the links be used say the first the other area is to use command codes from downward with permanent codes assigned from the number of links in use to i feel that it is quite unlikely that we would need more than for quite some time and moreover the network probably wouldn t handle traffic implied by heavy link assignment these two things aren t necessarily strongly coupled one can have many links assigned but only a few carrying traffic at any given time some of heafner s and harslen s other ideas may appear in nwg rfc form page rfc network meeting epilogue etc march immediate interaction during the next several days i will still be interested in those editicisms of current protocol which might lead to rejection or serious modification of it thereafter the focus will be a refinement implementation extension and utilization i may be reached at ucla through my secretary mrs benita kristel at also everyone is invited to contribuet to the nwg rfc series unique numbers are assigned by benita the cease on link facility is a way a receiving host modifies rfnm s so as to carry a flow quenching meaning an alternative proceedure is to use a host to host control command this rfc was put into machine readable form for entry into the online rfc archives by ron fitzherbert page
