 network working group h murray request for comments stanford research institute nic november tenex bandwidth nic rfc by g hicks and b wessler at utah recently discussed the cost of using the network i would like to take these same types of numbers and look at them from another point of view without calculating costs let us consider ultimate performance of the hosts i wrote a simple tenex program that sent itself strings over the net it used bin bout and the buffered send mode it counted things but did not process the string with samples of a million bits the following results were obtained bytes size real baud cpu baud cpu needed k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k the following were obtained by using sin sout without the buffered mode bytes size real baud cpu baud cpu needed k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k murray page rfc tenex bandwidth november these tests were run with no other load on our system an early version of the input and output halves of the transmission have been averaged together i e the above baud rates were calculated using million bits since the strings went out and in other pieces of data our tty s and lpt have ultimate cpu bandwidths near kb at baud a tty takes of the cpu telnets nested three deep are almost compute limited when just typing things out on a baud terminal as a rough calculation the bandwidth of the tip tape transmission feature using steve butterfield s of bbn netmag program is about kilobits sec one tape of about tenex pages took about hours to transmit this was a full tape from etac to cca late one night with nothing else running on our system about of the cpu is needed to maintain this bandwidth again this is only about kb per cpu sec this rfc was put into machine readable form for entry into the online rfc archives by helene morin via genie murray page
