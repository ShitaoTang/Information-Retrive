 network working group j winett request for comments mit lincoln laboratory nic march level iii server protocol for the lincoln laboratory host disclaimer this material has not been reviewed for public release and is intended only for use with the arpa network it should not be quoted or cited in any publication not related to the arpa network introduction the lincoln laboratory ibm is connected to the arpa network and acts as a serving host providing access to the cp virtual machine operating system upon completion of the login procedure users have control of a virtual machine through a virtual online console attached to the virtual machine is a virtual card reader card punch and line printer and a number of disk storage devices the virtual machine can be either a virtual with dynamic address translation hardware or a standard system most users run a standard with k bytes of virtual memory and operate the cms conversational monitor system cms provides facilities for file creation maintenance and manipulation program development debugging and execution and a number of other useful utility functions the section in the network notebook on the lincoln laboratory more fully describes the facilities available network control program all communication with the through the imp are processed by a network control program ncp the ncp operates with the host host protocol described in the network working group document no dated august initial connection protocol to create a virtual machine from the network a pair of connections must be made with the logger the sockets to be used are assigned following the initial connection protocol icp the logger is enabled and waiting for an rts control command for socket x a this icp socket corresponds to home x a user x and tag x send gender requests for connection on the icp socket are stacked until it becomes free if the logger is willing to winett page rfc level ii server protocol march service another network user a bit socket id of a receive socket will be sent over this initial connection and the icp socket will then be closed if the logger is not willing to service another network user it will not complete the initial connection for the icp socket and will refuse the request by closing the connection without completing it logger protocol once a pair of user sockets have been assigned the connection protocol should be completed on these sockets the logger then expects to receive on the receive socket one bit byte indicating the data type which characterizes the transmission code used to communicate with the network user over this pair of sockets a code of x implies bit ascii code in bit bytes with the leading bit zero a code of x implies bit ebcdic code when the data type code is received the logger will echo back the data type code over the send socket followed by the message lincoln laboratory cp online nl in the appropriate code in ascii nl is transmitted as cr lf the procedure continues according to the normal cp login protocol with the logger performing an additional function of mapping network userids and passwords into valid cp userids and passwords this mapping is specified by entries in a file the logger file which the logger accesses if a network userid does not match an entry in the file or if the password given does not match the corresponding network password the usual cp responses will be sent to the users thus network access to the lincoln laboratory system is restricted to those accounts for which an appropriate entry has been made in the logger file it should be noted that cp transmits a byp code bypass to suspend the printing of characters keyed while a password is being entered after the password has been entered cp transmits a res code restore to resume the printing when characters are keyed when communicating in ascii these character codes are converted to x ff since no corresponding ascii code is defined refer to the network resource notebook for more details on cp and on cms the net account lincoln laboratory is providing one account which can be used by network users to familiarize themselves with our time sharing system the userid of this account is net and the password is arpa this account has records of storage which can store approximately winett page rfc level ii server protocol march characters net users are free to erase any file on this account since many different people may use this account the server protocol cp operates on a line at a time i e a group of characters are processed as a line and not as a sequence of individual characters also the system does normally buffer input lines that is input is not normally entered until requested by a read from the system with ibm or terminals the keyboard is locked until a read is requested the virtual terminals through which network users have access to the cp system have been designed to support either a line oriented terminal or a character oriented terminal when cp requests a line of input the server transmits a prompting code x this character can be used to signal a user process to change transmission modes and to transmit an input line characters received by the server are buffered until a nl character is received lines received can then be used to satisfy cp requests for an input line cp may send out lines which may or may not end with a nl character if a line does not end with a nl character the prompting character will naturally be sent following the output line to request input to a cp process when a user wishes to interrupt a cp process i e to change modes an interrupt code x should be sent to the server this code will result in an asynchronous interrupt being sent to the running process stimulating the pressing of the attention button on a terminal together with the transmission of the interrupt code the user should cause an ins to be sent over the send link this signal will be synchronized with the interrupt code if the interrupt code has not yet been received and processed all characters buffered and those received before the receipt of the interrupt code will be flushed i e deleted when the interrupt code is received it will be paired with the previously received ins if an ins is received after an interrupt code has been received and processed the ins will be paired with this previously received interrupt code if cp has a line to send to a user after it has requested an input line but before it has received any input the server will transmit an ins on the user s receive link to notify the user that previously sent prompting character should be retracted and that a line has been or will be sent to the user this message line is called a warning winett page rfc level ii server protocol march graphic and control codes figure gives the bit codes for the ebcdic graphics and controls figure gives the bit codes for the ascii graphics and controls the controls are tabulated and compared in figure the standard interpretation of the ascii controls are given in figure there are ascii codes which do not have a corresponding graphic or control in the ebcdic code the ebcdic codes given to these codes are as follows hex code ascii symbol ascii ebcdic dc a c e there are ebcdic graphics codes and ebcdic control codes which do not have a corresponding graphic or control in the ascii code in addition there are other ebcdic codes whose interpretation is unspecified four of these codes have been chosen to correspond to the ascii control and ascii graphics which do not have a corresponding ebcdic code when converting ebcdic codes to ascii codes the remaining codes plus the ebcdic graphics and ebcdic controls not counting nl are converted into the code x ff the nl character is treated specially the nl character ebcdic code x is converted into the two character sequence cr lf i e ascii x d a as stated above the code x is transmitted as a prompting character whenever cp requests an input line on converting from ascii to ebcdic if any code other than the ascii codes or the interrupt codem x is received it is converted to the code x ff in addition whenever the two ascii characters cr lf are found sequentially in the input stream they are converted into the single ebcdic character nl in figure positions shown as cannot be printed in ascii winett page rfc level
