 network working group john melvin request for comments sri arc march imp imp teletype communication i have occasionally found myself in a situatuation in which i see a message from site x on my imp teletype but i don t know the time and date of the message i find this annoying since a response to it may be in order if it is say less than an hour old but not if it is several hours old the situation is not improved by the existence of sites that now span all time zones of the u s and do not have direct voice connection it is requested that everyone tag their imp to imp tele type messages that cause no response at the receiving imp the transmitting imp site should use hour time and include the time zone designation this rfc was put into machine readable form for entry into the online rfc archives by larry campbell
