network working note steve crocker ucla rfc april conversation with bob kahn i talked with bob kahn at bb n yesterday we talked about code conversion in the imp s imp host communication and host software bb n is prepared to convert or bit character codes into bit ascii for transmission and convert again upon assembly at the destination imp bb n plans a one for one conversion scheme with tables unique to the host i suggested that places with bit codes may also want case shifting bob said this may result in overflow if too many case shifts are necessary i suggested that this is rare and we could probably live with an overflow indication instead of a guarantee with respect to host imp communication we now have a five bit link field and a bit to indicate conversion also possible is a bit conversion indicator one for converting before sending and one for converting after this would allow another handle for checking or controlling the system the host can send messages or portions of a message to its imp specifying tracing conversion whether message is for destination imp or host send rfnm host up or down synchronization format error messages master link clear status requested the imp can send to its host information on conversion refnm arrived imp up or down synchornization called host not responding format error status in imp i also summarized for bob the contents of network notes l and
