 network working group a bhushan mit request for comments r kanodia mit nic r metcalfe mit categories c and d j postel ucla june comments on byte size for connections there are at least the following three views on the use of byte size for network connections byte size should not be used at all byte size is solely for the convenience of ncp s byte size choice is a user level prerogative according to the first view network connections are bit streams and messages should contain bit counts i e a byte size of this view existed before the glitch cleaning of rfc and was discarded in favour of byte stream because of stated reasons of efficiency in storage management and message concatenation the second view represents a special interpretation of rfc according to this interpretation byte size is entirely a nd level i e ncp issue there is no require ment that rd level user processes be able to specify byte size this view is indicated in rfc by shoshani byte size for connection is the byte size selected by sending ncp as explained in rfc output of host host protocol glitch cleaning committee page rfc nic according to the third view user processes are always allowed to choose byte size for connection either explicitly specify a specific byte size parameter or implicitly byte size depends on i o mode an ncp is allowed to use a default byte size if the user does not specify it the correct view the third view should be considered the correct interpre tation of rfc in fact rfc states on page the choice of the byte size for a connection is a rd level protocol issue to be consistent with telnet icp and other rd level protocols which require that a specific byte size be used for connection it is imperative that corresponding rd level processes be able to specify and impose a particular byte size to the ncp ncp implementors should take note of it on specifying fixed byte sizes in rd level protocols holding the view that byte size choice is a rd level issue we are still faced with the following two questions first is it appropriate for rd level protocols to legislate a specific byte size for all connections using that protocol second if it is appropriate to specify byte size then what should this choice be page rfc nic there are two arguments in favour of using specific byte size in rd level protocols first is that a potential mismatch problem exists because rfc does not require that ncps be capable of handling all byte sizes through using a fixed byte size of bits or bit multiples resolves the problem as this is acceptable to all hosts including terminal imps the second argument is one of efficiency if it is agreed before hand that only a specific byte size would be used it is possible to make programs more efficient i e reduce program space and possibly run time the efficiency argument assumes that the byte size for connection represents the natural byte structure of data being transferred over the connection for telnet and icp the byte size choice is straight forward as data is naturally in bit multiples bit ascii characters in telnet and bit socket numbers in icp but for data transfer protocols the byte size choice is more complex as data may be structured in a variety of byte sizes specifying a byte size for a data transfer connection reduces efficiency in instances where connection byte size does not correspond to data byte size further filler fields will be required for data blocks which are not a multiple of the fixed byte size this imposes an additional overhead page rfc nic even if all hosts were to accept arbitrary byte sizes and the rd level protocol does not legislate a specific byte size the inefficiency problem will not be solved entirely under current specifications the byte size is fixed for the life of a connection this means that byte size cannot be varied during the life of a connection even if structure of data varies the problem of inefficiency is solved only for instances in which data has a constant byte structure given the current state of the network it appears that specifying fixed byte size in rd level protocols is a good idea this eliminates the potential byte size mismatch problem and improves efficiency at least for telnet and icp in data transfer the efficiency issue is more complex as discussed earlier it is not clear that overall efficiency would be degraded if a fixed byte size was required on reopening the byte size issue the above discussion exposes certain weaknesses in the efficiency arguments for having byte streams on network connec tions in moving from bit stream to byte stream we may have lost generality and it is not clear how much overall efficiency is gained sometimes the gain in ncp efficiency may be at the expense of user process efficiencies rfc page page rfc nic it is also clear that for efficiency arguments to hold the byte size choice should not be an ncp prerogative it is the combined efficiency rather than ncp efficiency which should be our primary concern restricting byte size choice to ncps has the further disadvantage of potential byte size mismatch not only between communicating npcs but also at the user ncp interface therefore allowing a user process to specify byte size is a step in the right direction given that we have adopted byte streams it is our opinion that the issue of bit stream and byte stream be set aside until serious consideration can be given to a major host host protocol overhaul at a later stage we will have a better idea of the relative efficiency merits this rfc was put into machine readable form for entry into the online rfc archives by bbn corp under the direction of alex mckenzie page
