 network working group robert t braden request for comments ucla ccn nic november tenex ftp problem tenex users of ftp should beware of a problem in the current tenex implementation which is likely to cause incorrect results when transferring files to a non tenex site some tenex programs create an ascii us unit separator character as an end of line indicator instead of cr lf the current tenex ftp user implementation passes these us characters over the network instead of translating them to cr lf as required by ftp protocol if the recipient is not a tenex he will not do anything special with these us characters and the line spacing will be lost in the case of sending to ccn we will treat it as a very long logical record and fold it into successive records a circumvention is to pass the tenex file through some tenex program that does the necessary conversion before sending it over the network we know that teco will remove us s there are probably other means loading and saving the file with teco will replace all us s with cr lf sequences this rfc was put into machine readable form for entry into the online rfc archives by katsunori tanaka braden page
