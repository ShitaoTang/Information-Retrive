 nwg rfc john r pickens ucsb online graphics edward d faeh nic ucsb sept at present users with tektronix or imlac terminals or with systems that support the proposed level graphics protocol can access ucsb graphics listed below are the icp sockets for the currently supported terminals and protocols any detailed questions about or problems with a particular protocol should be directed to ed faeh socket supports x imlac with special software designed by jerry powell mitre corp graphics is sent over a simplex connection to the imlac alphanumerics are sent over a telnet like connection to a separate device the imlac software can be loaded from mit dmcg x imlac with x display grid and standard text and edit package some imlacs have a x display grid therefore the choice may be made in the near future to format the graphics output from this connection for the smaller grid resolution so that both terminal types may be handled display resolution is limited with this terminal configuration as normal ucsb terminals have x grid nevertheless meaningful displays are obtained even at the lower resolutions x current level graphics protocol x same as x but with special ucsb online keyboard as input this configuration averts the necessity of spelling out online operators x same as x but with special ucsb online keyboard as input page nwg rfc jrp edf sep ucsb online graphics x tektronix terminals models a and t have been tested successfully presumably all other compatible terminals will also work the primary problems that will be encountered by the network user center about display formatting for historical reasons i e only one type of terminal in house no means were included in the system to facilitate terminal independent random positioning of alphanumeric output thus a program which draws and labels a graph neatly on one terminal might label like a kindergartener on other terminals nevertheless this problem can be minimized with careful programming and efforts are underway to provide at least minimal alphanumeric device independence users interested in experimenting with online graphics should contact john pickens glen davis or mark krilonovich suggestions and criticisms of all aspects of the ucsb online network user interface are desired this rfc was put into machine readable form for entry into the online rfc archives by bbn corp under the direction of alex mckenzie page
