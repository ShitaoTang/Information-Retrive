 network working group bob bressler rfc bbn nic march data transfer revisited a lot of work has recently gone into the development and refinement of both the rje and ftp protocols stepping back from the details and small issues we can describe the two protocols as a control connection over which commands are passed and a data connection over which uninterpreted by the server process data is passed both protocols deal with the concept of identifying oneself to the server setting up parameters and transferring some data new ideas and concepts such as the hot card reader have been introduced into one protocol or the other but these concepts are generally applicable to both in addition a great deal of effort was made to make the structures of the two protocols be as similar as possible this discussion is of course leading to the suggestion that we stop considering these as two separate protocols and merge them into a single unit perhaps resurrecting the name of data transfer several advantages besides simplicity are gained by this sites need only build one server program given that they can always respond with command not implemented this will also prevent the rje users and servers from having to start up a possibly separate ftp user and server saving the resulting doubling of programs and telnet connections the further advantage of insuring that new ideas and concepts will be shared by all users and servers will also be realized a rje user will be able to transfer his deck of cards file to storage on another machine s file system using the hot card reader previously defined only in the rje protocol the command set of the combined protocol would now consist of several sets of command types these sets include a general system commands e g user help b parameter settings e g type stru c data control e g abort rein bressler page rfc data transfer revisited march d file operation e g stor retr list e job execution e g input output change i will not try to completely specify the syntax of each command since they are still being finalized left as an exercise for the reader an implementor who was only interested in file transfer would implement the general data transfer routines and the small set of file transfer commands another site might also wish to implement the job execution commands users at traditional rje stations would be able to store their files on machines that do not support other rje functions by using the file transfer command package in their user machine at some later date they can connect to a batch server elsewhere on the net and instruct it to accept its input from the site currently storing the files thus card reader availability and access to a batch machine would not need to be concurrent in an effort to get a feel for the complexity of this suggestions the latest ftp offering rfc was compared with the rje document the amount of change to the rje document was in fact relatively small and will perhaps constitute a subsequent rfc a possible course of action then would be to take the official ftp resulting from the march meeting at bbn and divide the commands into data transfer and file transfer components the rje documents can then be revised or rewritten such that the new data transfer protocol will also have an rje subset this would be accomplished by recognizing and removing those parts of the rje that dealt with data transfer leaving a command subset dealing exclusively with job submission and execution this course of action is intended to cause minimal perturbation on current implementations the intention of this suggestion is not to try and pack everything into a single protocol but to make the large body of common code the transfer of data available to current and new protocols new ideas be they mail or load sharing could be developed more easily given the common availability of this data transfer mechanism rb jm this rfc was put into machine readable form for entry into the online rfc archives by alex mckenzie with support from gte formerly bbn corp bressler page
