 network working group a mckenzie rfc bbn net nic february telnet protocol meeting announcement since the publication of rfc there have been a great number of proposals for changes and or extensions to the still unofficial telnet protocol it now seems appropriate to have a meeting of concerned parties to try once again to reach a consensus position and define an official protocol with perhaps some room for optional expansion accordingly i hereby announce a telnet protocol meeting to be held at ucla on monday march i expect this to be a working meeting rather than a tutorial to bring new members of the network community up to speed and therefore wish to invite the attendance of only those individuals prepared to discuss at least those issues which have already been raised at a minimum attendees should be familiar with the following rfc rfc rfc rfc rfc rfc rfc a familiarity with deliberations of the telnet committee prior to rfc would probably also be helpful finally attendees should be aware that there are few no hosts which follow the echo control conventions described in rfc anyone wishing to attend this meeting should contact alex mckenzie at bbn nic ident aam moulton street cambridge mass l my telephone number is ext when there is some indication of the number of individuals planning to attend a meeting room will be selected a time announced etc this rfc was put into machine readable form for entry into the online rfc archives by alex mckenzie with support from gte formerly bbn corp mckenzie page
