 network working group a shoshani request for comments sdc nic may a solution to the race condition in the icp in nwg rfc a race condition in the icp was described and a solution was suggested the problem arises because the host host protocol does not specify what the ncp should do when it gets more than one request of str or rts to the same socket as a result this decision depends on the particular implementation some may queue these requests sdc for example some will refuse a request if the socket is already connected ucla for example etc the solution is not to change the host host protocol but find a third level icp which does not depend on this issue such a solution is the following the inits from server to user and user to server s s u u on page in rfc should use another socket say u and u the sequences in rfc would be server user s listen l u init u l s wait for match u s send l s u receive u s s close l u close u s init s u bu u init u s bu s init s u bs u init u s bs this solution will solve the problems pointed out in rfc without any assumptions made about the ncp implementation the solution in rfc assumes that the ncp can notify a process when a command e g close comes in which is implementation dependent this rfc was put into machine readable form for entry into the online rfc archives by alan ford shoshani page
