 network working group edwin w meyer jr request for comments mit project mac network information center december network meeting notes the following summary was transcribed from notes i took at three network meetings held in houston during the fall joint computer conference although i have tried to be objective unavoidably these notes present a biased view of the meetings this is due in part to my preoccupation with certain topics and possible misunderstanding of various discussions while i have tried to accurately paraphrase the statements of the attendees the import of some may have been twisted attendees of monday meeting dick benjamin mitre jack bouknight ui cac al cocanower mirut steve crocker ucla dough engelbart sri richard greenblatt mit mac eric harslem rand frank heart bbn

notes december network meeting pm monday crocker not everybody is here so lets talk until more people get here is everybody satisfied with the agenda in my announcement meyer we should talk about logger protocol operational usage of the net work as opposed to experiments depends on its implementation introductions to all around crocker i have an agenda but want suggestions for topics i will make introductory remarks i will list topics of concern englebart will talk about the network information center i will review the status of sites introductory remarks arpa will not pay for the coffee and pastry being served so please chip in to help me pay for it i am going to devote full time to network coordination in an official capacity my goals are a to build up usability of the network b to establish protocol levels c areas of importance some site of coalition of sites should prepare a method by which a site s ncp could be checked out reworking of ncp protocol some issues could be solved better a error control b flow control c overloading loosing network states d simplification and relayering of protocol telnet system console interaction or logger protocol how to get into the system and how to get help when in trouble documentation of individual hosts network info center involved perhaps each site could be provided with a facsimile device more sophisticated consoles particularly graphics consoles to be attached through network there should be a working group to formulate and workout a format for handling sophisticated consoles there will be a graphics meeting in january in colorado or utah the price of admission is to write a proposal i expect up to people i will pick a small subset to develop specifications meyer page rfc network meeting notes december accounting in the nd half of more sites will come on where accounting is important they want to send bills larry roberts says that there will be a kind of banking system with bills passed around two types of sites billing sites and free but limited access research sites i see no fundamental problems what happens when a research site talks to a billing site i think it is do able measurements the network is a tool but it is also a model that is better than a simulation package various people want to make measurements this could be supported by keeping statistics in ncp s what about increasing the ncp s to include these long putting accounting and measuring into ncp s costs space keep additions to a minimum weissman what about scheduled availability of various systems crocker this has to be coordinated with each individual system what happens to connections when a system goes down crocker what about graphics proposals i will write my own paper as a proposal it uses the dec as a model modes assumes scope system a memory both output input are included in standards making i want a competent protocol to be developed out of the working group crocker what about documentation meyer documentation on how to use other systems are a must only this can motivate operational use of the network what about putting documents on line at each site or at least abstracts crocker what sites have documents on line mit and harvard how do the sites feel about keeping documents on some foreign system crocker what about reworking the protocol harslem we have logged into the ucsb system and are debugging cooperatively harslem we are impressed with eliminating marking and padding per rfc meyer page rfc network meeting notes december crocker we discussed this with the sites most seemed to accept it but some reservations what about changes to the basic protocol i m meyer has something to say meyer the position at project mac is that at this point we are opposed to changes other than critical fixes time spent on changes is time that won t be spent on developing other necessary and interesting protocols and systems and we at multics have a long lead time for creation and installation of changes weissman i prefer to put in changes in one chunk say at month intervals rather than in bits pieces o sullivan can t current and new systems work simultaneously crocker if the changes involve the imp no because all imps want to operate the same system meyer the feeling at m i t is that to be a success the network needs desperately to be used operationally if another year passes without significant operational use it might go down the drain and documentation is critical towards motivating operational usage engelbart perhaps we should put off graphics several months so as not to delay typewriters typewriters are important but would that be sufficiently impressive for dod people engelbart but if it turns out to be a can of worms in two years but do the two typewriters and graphics development groups interact vezza and engelbart yes crocker let s hear more about this harslem we want to be able to access files crocker then perhaps the graphics effort would dilute typewriter development is it the consensus of this group that we shouldn t have a graphics meeting vezza newcomers should work on graphics not established people prohibit current people form going to this meeting meyer page rfc network meeting notes december meyer that would be very frustrating benjamin why not solicit position papers but have no meeting weissman character transmission is easier than graphic transmission more experiments needed for graphics the lead time for developing a graphic protocol is much longer than for typewriters vezza i agree crocker there will be more meetings in the next few days to work on problems of getting useful work over the network intermission pm crocker engelbart will speak on network information center engelbart nic grew as an ad hoc thing with no specific directives from arpa what kinds of things were envisioned sophisticated query systems basic information about systems at each site everyone feels very vulnerable about the state of documentation at his own site everyone agrees better documents necessary we see ourselves as providing the following services collecting hard copy material on line querying of catalogs and indices of these giving access to this material we decided to go hard copy rather than on line perhaps on microfiche engelbart as was to be used for the documentation system expandable as usage increase we are switching form a to a x to better expand service capacity amount of capacity goes up considerably this has held up work on other facets a conscious gamble we are worried about getting of the ground we are short on funds for more secondary storage and are interested in using other hosts for tertiary storage the cost of implementing the protocol on the was too high for potential gains so it was given up few sites would be up by january when our was to be shipped out engelbart we have created a network dialogue system this is a network of human agents at each site there is a technical communications agent secretary and b a technical liaison person we are encouraging agents to talk to us and have created enterprise phone numbers so they can talk toll free meyer page rfc network meeting notes december engelbart we are at first sending out a tiny kit to each agent a growing collection of network reference information one person agent at each site is to be trained to handle the set of documents and retrieve information of contact another site s technical liaison this involves a public dialogue keeping a record of the documents passing back and forth this is a sort of human imp network structured as follows local one reference site material other sites local users agent master collection has all material each local collection has a subset considered most useful what about restricting access to documents engelbart all files are public files in this system vezza you can send a private memo rather than use the nic service engelbart the master collection contains books and other documents cataloged on line hard copy stuff can be duplicated for information that passes the value test the service is to store catalog index and provide access to documents we will support a number of different terminal we are prepared to go a long time with hard copy items but can establish a hard copy to on line transcription service for a price weissman what about distributing ocr selectric balls to sites will nic take what is sent or actively search it out meyer page rfc network meeting notes december engelbart more or less what comes our way a system will exist in spring to allow an agent to insert items into a catalog the dialogue that goes on will determine which way the data base grows we are pretty sure that eventually sri will have to charge because of many potential users not at primary sites seeking limit resources what about an ncp for your x engelbart if bbn s ncp is ready by february we ll use it crocker how do people get access engelbart each site is registered any person who gets in on a site s account has its access we won t worry about accounting until saturation occurs we would like to encourage use of the agent system to create and use a survey of resources at each site some subgroup should talk about this crocker when can people meet to discuss this tomorrow morning engelbart we have nice facilities for developing mailing lists private bibliographies personnel profiles but it depends on the interest of the network people engelbart agents have been set up with mit ucla rand ui utah etc a good percentage of sites vezza many sites are sending out stuff rd and th class takes too much time crocker site status report illiac iv not to be operational until mid on network later other possible sites radc aws ncar currently up ucsb rand imminent january mit bbn harvard ucla utah ll sdc some percentage by end of year rest in january heart a brand new imp system major change goes in tomorrow some more sites are thinking about coming on the network will grow consider ably beyond what s already on board we too are interested in site resource information no long term interest but we will put information on paper to help arpa crocker a lot of people are yawning what about meeting schedules during fjcc s day vs day meetings what about dual east and west coast meetings end of meeting meyer page rfc network meeting notes december network meeting am tuesday crocker engelbart will talk in more detail later may discuss logger protocol and file transfer engelbart basic thing is a collection of documents with a catalog to describe it entry has lots of data items including where to find it techniques for adding and updating entries we do it now but would want to give capability to other sides partly because we can t determine what s of value displayed types of printout catalog listing by ordinal index in collection and nic index for inventory control finding out what s there compacted format on one line sorted by author one line per entry we will have procedures where an untrained user can manage a collection meyer how are these systems implemented engelbart we have a compiler compiler on the our subsystems are written in specialized high level language we are moving this over to the x heart how many people can the x support in rough figures engelbart perhaps collections perhaps people could supply own dec tapes for additional storage engelbart could but requires on site operator slow access we don t have money for more storage but are considering shipping files down to ucsb we provide on line querying of on line data willing to worry about data management whether or not we store it crocker please describe the various subsystems description by engelbart follows heart have people tried to use it over the network engelbart no don t have an ncp on the decided against putting it in a system that is going away the biggest hang up is when x gets an ncp bobrow developing it but it is slipping heart who is going to get at it sri early ui illinois can access only sri to begin with meyer page rfc network meeting notes december postel ucla we plan to use it heart would be a significant task if someone would take it as a goal to get into engelbart s system mitre we re going to use other systems form bbn s x engelbart we are trying to isolate essential subsystems for people to use easily files are organized hierarchically and will fill out as years go by documents are referenced by pathnames discussion of systems follows crocker row does one get into the system engelbart describes entry sequence to todas crocker how does one get registered on the system engelbart ultimately by personal entry but currently there is one user id per site meyer i think we re ignoring unsolved problems in the typewriter interfacing for example the entry sequence to todas where the user type one or two characters and the system types out the remaining chars of a key word will be frustrating to use form half duplex system like multics our system will not recognize an input line until a new line is typed various discussion of duplex communication brings out distinction between a full duplex systems where system echoes input vs duplex where input typed locally and b systems where each character is recognized as it is typed in vs systems where entire line is recognized only after eol char crocker isn t multics the only half duplex line oriented system on the net work meyer i can t believe this don t the ibm systems operate like that engelbart we could have a duplex interface on our system sri is it the multics hardware that enforces this restriction meyer yes the input output controller the multics io controller s typewriter adaptor is duplex but can accept break characters other than the new line character meyer page rfc network meeting notes december engelbart each system should have a preprocessor to talk with other systems we re going to put a graphics interface onto the network meyer how do you view these interfaces do these adhere to some network standard or ill each system construct an interface to you engelbart standard network protocol crocker let s move on to other things o sullivan what about s on your cmu x system do you have serious interfacing problems cmu s s go through a software package that transforms them into tty s no serious difficulty various brief discussion on how multics handles input sundberg harvard out x can take char oriented input but our higher level subsystems prefer line oriented input what about the efficiency of transmitting messages through the network one character at a time crocker there is more output which goes packed than input so the input inefficiency is negligible engelbart we plan to have several different ports into our system if each system had an nic module it could communicate with us without the necessity of a login we prefer a batch type system where a site sends spooled batch of edit requests gets stuff back and frees ports the typewriter transmission by line problem could be handled similar to spooled up requests we encourage spooling but will support interactive users we can support more batch than inter active people the multics io controller s typewriter adaptor is duplex but can accept break characters other than the new line character vezza do people feel that the full and duplex issue is a problem let all the people go back and find out about this m i t with a full and duplex system feet apart can help here o sullivan there seem to be issues echoing full duplex vs duplex single character vs full line transmission meyer page rfc network meeting notes december crocker two definitions serving host provides computation using host parasitic manages user s terminal this view network usage as a link between local user and foreign server vezza what about duplex full duplex interconnection if some full duplex systems echo other than what was input crocker two independent possibilities let s diagram hard wire separate local echo lines all computer does printed not echo process hard x each character process x easy only after eol crocker i claim there are really only two possibilities marked by x s postel why about a system where echoing is done at such a low level that it can t be deleted crocker if so it s like non echoing van zoeren out system thinks we have full duplex tty s but our s are attached via a software transformation box meyer what happens when non echoing systems are attached to echoing systems via the network i type my input line then the echoing system responds with my input then some output my system can t filter this because there is no way of differentiating echo from output crocker this isn t necessarily a bad thing i type command abbreviation to sri then next output line is an expanded form of the input command meyer our goal should be one common protocol rather than a bunch of kludgy schemes to implement communication between specific pairs of hosts meyer page rfc network meeting notes december long sdc we prefer to receive a full line fed through the network crocker let s differentiate between research centers and service centers only the service centers are concerned with a half duplex interface lower left hand x on chart these include sri bbn multics o sullivan what about research center crocker they can call up service centers but may themselves be hard to use illinois then the illiac iv will have to be half duplex postel i think half duplex line oriented is weaker than full duplex character oriented protocol sundberg harvard can go either way but prefer line oriented system engelbart graphics terminals harder to put on network because of non standard input harslem you re thinking of the keys as function keys rather than input keys engelbart i m worried about people who want to use graphics o sullivan we haven t spoken to the problem of what kind of protocol should be established crocker that s not a difficult technical thing we ll get to that later and make a decision meyer i m not authorized to make any decision i m to report back to the mac group crocker okay then a proposal to be accepted through the normal mechanism intermission crocker i will propose how to handle x ed boxes ignoring hard and ease boxes line oriented input bit ascii including end of line character n c cn cn eol meyer page rfc network meeting notes december n n is the character count in an bit field the character count precedes the line so as to give the software system the same efficiency as the hardware system the computer doesn t have to scan for the eol vezza don t you get the length information with the imp message crocker my philosophy is that imp message boundaries should be completely invisible long i object to splitting typewriter messages into two separate chunks crocker what is your objection lines beginning on message boundaries or message not beginning on a line boundary long both engelbart each host should write an interface to handle the most common terminal types crocker the official protocol does not allow imp message boundaries to have any significance engelbart i don t want to worry about imp message boundaries the network should be invisible at this level vezza long we ll concede we ll go along meyer i d like to change the restriction the last character in the line packet need not be an eol as when an output does not advance to a ne line but an eol cannot appear in the midst of a packet van zoeren i don t like this restriction meyer count tells us that any eol is at the end we need not scan crocker the eol is the character that tells the system to take action harslem our system has function keys not just one eol crocker how about if c e breakset i n this s more complex because have to transmit a breakset i ll propose this in a moment how about this message oriented duplex connection meyer page rfc network meeting notes december between user and server hosts for console interaction local echo no server echo this is for line oriented service systems these are slight generalizations of multics conventions meyer i m sure other systems other than multics use it it s not as bad as you seem to think engelbart upper management should know that it is bad meyer that s not clear there are efficiency questions van zoeren i don t want to have to transmit files this way crocker this is for consoles not file transmission engelbart we need a unified scheme for data transmission o sullivan for consoles we re to devise a way to tell a system where its interrupt should be simulated crocker there is a general problem of data transmission for tapes and files o sullivan but we have the specific problem of implementing typewriter communications engelbart but what we need is a general way of sending stuff through the network so it is invisible and have the host interpret it as it wants to meyer there should be one console interface for the network not several at each site crocker this problem is perhaps overblown engelbart meyer o sullivan discussion about supporting specific terminal types engelbart i ll draw a graph of systems vs terminal type the intersection of a system and a terminal that is accepted by that system is marked by a dot network communication problem is one of finding a terminal at local host that is also supported at the target host meyer page rfc network meeting notes december systems terminals crocker there is a general problem of a subsystem reacting to input let s propose that input should be sent as a full message or in multiples of bits vezza are we constraining too much meyer why is it necessary to have bit multiples crocker engelbart okay throw that away end of second meeting network meeting pm wednesday the following notes are greatly condensed and attempt only to present the major themes discussed at this meeting crocker let s meet at the sjcc with more prior organization let s have several day meetings at month intervals we ve got a lot of good discussion on the next level protocol let a subgroup work if out harslem volunteers to redraft the logger protocol proposed in rfc meyer will revise proposal in rfc meyer let s go back discuss these issues write proposals later we have an open meeting to decide on a formal proposal crocker small group is better perhaps i ll pick a subset meyer page rfc network meeting notes december vezza it s true that things aren t settled here major proposals should be on paper preparatory to a meeting we can t legislate what a small group does it has no more authority than an individual karp of mitre volunteers to produce a bibliography of network documents perhaps by january who has implemented logger protocol ucsb and ucla mod have or are planning sdc may have it by found it awkward willing to change discussion of file transmission crocker proposes that a future protocol change might attach a byte size such as bits to a connection regarding control links everything is transmitted in bit bytes except eco erp err commands no objection was voiced to changing the protocol so that they also must be multiples of bit bytes discussion of how to specify the end of a file prior transmission of bit count or send eor character at end suggestion that we want global solution to the general problem of sending an arbitrary length message rather than just file transmission discussion of transaction units or record sizes what is an optimum transaction unit size imp message boundaries are invisible by protocol fiat and are not connected with this discussion multics block size was brought up nearest thing is page size words how to specify end of file engelbart says send data packets then eof packet crocker suggests that clsing connection can act as eof vezza suggests that imp message boundaries be used to determine end if less than full imp message this is last part of file meyer suggests use of two connections data channel and control channel over which all control messages such as file name bit length etc are passed discussion concerning different situations in which whole file part of the file or the whole file in arbitrary chunks was wanted meyer why not defer this and talk about typewriter communications which is most critical vezza engelbart wants a clean general solution meyer page rfc network meeting notes december crocker if we get an ad hoc solution now it may interfere with implementing a general solution later crocker proposes format for transmitting a file of arbitrary length records of fixed sized bytes of bits a record is less than bytes each record is headed by a count byte n m n m record record o sullivan does this model fit a terminal which has character and graphic modes discussion about differences between keyboard and file transmission uncertainty as to whether a global solution would fit both who wants to ship files through the network multics and rand to ucla mitre using bbn crocker let s go away thinking about this and propose solutions later harslem proposes format for transmitting data with operation codes each record consists of gives the opportunity to send many type of status info discussion regarding sending data and control information intermixed or on separate connections issues of pollution of data vs synchronization and race problems claimed that synchrony problems are easily overcome suggestion that we really don t know much about this area we should go off and write intermission crocker what has to be done before we can log onto other systems meyer issues ho to establish the connection what is the character set what is the mode of transmission relating to full and duplex problem discussion of orienting standard protocol towards service systems which generally are line oriented and duplex any systems offering services to have a duplex interface meyer page rfc network meeting notes december discussion of whether possible or desirable for the logger protocol to allow transmission of partial lines in a imp message less efficient to take partial lines reasonable to send full line pointed out that ncp protocol disallows any meaning to imp message boundaries so systems must be prepared to accept lines straddling imp message boundaries however best to send complete line discussion of whether line oriented protocol protocol should bend so as to accept single character transmission from full duplex systems seems that we are coming up with a protocol to allow any system to use a line oriented system to use a char oriented system form other systems is more difficult and requires a separate protocol heart i am in favor of an immediate solution postel once something goes in it will be hard to change it crocker i think these meetings will turn out to be more important than we ever wanted them to be i am more concerned with the long term effects than the starting date van zoeren if we don t decide it somebody else will decide it the bad way this rfc was put into machine readable form for entry into the online rfc archives by gottfried janik meyer page
