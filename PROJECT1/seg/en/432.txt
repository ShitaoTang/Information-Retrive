 network working group s crocker request for comments ucla sept response to nwm rfc bill s suggestion is a good one however my current policy is to encourage the most rapid implementation of the protocol in document and his suggested modification should be delayed it seems to me most important to gain experience using the network before making changes to the protocol which are not dictated by necessity i polled several sites regarding bill s suggestion sites with ncp implementations under way tended to agree with this policy while sites further behind tended to desire bill s suggested change with respect to changes in general i believe that changes are necessary to improve the efficiency provide greater flexibility and guarantee reliability many of us can suggest changes now but i suspect that clearer ideas will emerge from usage this rfc was put into machine readable form for entry into the online rfc archives by josh elliott page
