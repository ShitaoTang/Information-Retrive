 network working group j postel request for comments ucla category c d computer science nic april obsoletes none updates none bytes it is somewhat unclear what to do with the byte size parameter now allowed by the nd level protocol i can conceive of an implementation in which the rd level programs never see this parameter crocker implies in rfc that control of this parameter is given to the rd level programs and that both sender and receiver may specify values of the byte size to the ncp there are at least two interpretations if the sender and receiver specify different byte sizes i the first is that the connection is illegal ii the second is that the ncp must parse the data stream on receipt from the network and into a buffer according to be byte size of the sender and subsequently parse the data stream on transfer from the buffer to the receiver in this second case there are two sub cases a one is to consider bits as the basic unit for example if the sender specified byte size and the receiver specified byte size then receiver ncp sender buffer b the other is to consider bytes as the significant unit and pad on the right or left or truncate to make things fit or other transformation at ucla computer science we are contemplating allowing sender and receiver to specify different byte sizes and consider bits as the basic unit case ii a this does not rule out our considering the second subcase case ii b we may allow rd level programs to specify a library or user supplied routine to perform the postel page rfc bytes april transformation between sender and receiver bytes perhaps these transformation routines would be written in the data reconfiguration language this rfc was put into machine readable form for entry into the online rfc archives by duncan de waal postel page
