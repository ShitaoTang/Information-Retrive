they are working with sites to determine terminal requirements heafner page rfc minutes of network working group meeting may o the resource notebook has been compiled and distributed twelve of sites are included in the notebook sdc has since reported stanford sri ai mit dm utah carnegie ll have not provided an entry bbn again made a call for responses and asked that each site stay up to date a

of the year is to the following five sites ames mitre rome etac in washington d c and nbs o bbn has been studying performance of network to learn ways to improve it an earlier rand rfc reported a very low rate for a total network experiment rand re ran the experiment to examine just the subnet performance and reported the subnet rate to be in the k bit range for that test mit dm has reported a kb

to provide daily weather information to etac in washington o etac has and in washington to produce summaries for longer range use the may go on the network air force sites reported by arpa o to export technology to other regions two air force sites oklahoma city oklahoma and sacramento california will temporarily join the arpa net to talk only to each other in an operation to parallel their autodin connection if it materializes they will run for the first six months of but probably won t continue the motivation is to examine the net ideas for developing a wholly autonomous network in three or four years heafner page rfc minutes of network working group meeting may other reports dept comm canada the canadian government wishes to optimize the use of all computers in canada they now have a banking network they are interested in a small net for universities their largest problem is the size of the country in relation to the sparseness of population u of chicago the university of chicago has no current time schedule but they have definite ideas about what they wish to accomplish and they are seeking funding they are applying to nsf to support a local net on campus for lab automation they have good people and good equipment the idea is to make it coherent their interest in the arpa network is to make shared software available to their people and to a limited extent make local services available to other arpa nodes their proposed host is a pdp to the mini computers and a second host pdp as a big software engine to make data available to the mini computers the pdp and pdp will perhaps be linked together they also expect to get a tip to provide remote number crunching for their people united kingdom they have proposed three main machines and three terminal nodes they have in mind the a approximately the in power their post office also has plans for a digital network in the distant future merit merit univ mich most of the bugs are out of the hardware most of the software is written heafner page rfc minutes of network working group meeting may will have pdp s by the end of the summer that are capable of transmission from one to another they will need and are now studying a telnet like protocol they are concerned with orderly communication of the two processors will later become concerned about process process communication educom educom involves major universities including most of those now in the arpa network for two years they have been running a network without wires they assume the arpa network can resolve the technical issues they are looking into marketing contracts documenting etc for running the network they have conducted a survey of universities polled about their interests in the arpa network of are interested have money and are ready to become sites raytheon they will access the net through the four boston nodes their interests include experiments of file transfer conversions indexing behavioral data to allow one to search an index to see if the body of data of interest is within the network miscellaneous topics graphics al vezza will host a july meeting of a small group interested in network graphics the price of admission is a sincere interest working background and a prepared talk ncp protocols a new official document will replace document and rfc implementation should not be held up because of the absence of this new document the long range protocol committee chaired by carnegie has been disbanded heafner page rfc minutes of network working group meeting may imlac users group a quick survey was taken to determine which sites had or planned to get an imlac the plan is to form an imlac users group the following sites have or plan to get one ucla s ames bbn sri arc stanford mit dm mit multics mitre case raytheon u of illinois official document formats the notion of a functional document was suggested one of which would be the document of official protocols with divisions of levels of protocols heafner page rfc minutes of network working group meeting may ii monday morning session network information center plans for nic two activities are planned for this summer off line mail and on line access the off line service will continue after the on line service has come into being plans for getting on the net via pdp replaced xds are almost complete response times for display use are marginal the activities will be developed in stages stage june nic will work with west coast sites this will involve providing nls facilities to allow people to create messages with initial delivery as hardcopy etc with automatic generation of catalog entry and nic this system has been used locally for about a month stage august nic will be open to the net community as a whole remote users will come in directly to the on line system and will have on line access to the catalog users will be trained either at sri or at their own sites before coming on four to eight concurrent terminals will be supported stage will include file transfer protocol on line delivery of messages remote editing of sri located text prior to stage a course will be offered on june for ucla rand sdc ucsb ames and radc for the use of stage the second group of users after stage will use nic to do their own site documentation concepts recommendations for documentation the nic is a unique name for reference it has no other meaning other numbering schema such as rfc numbers will eventually go away however the subgroups such as rfcs will remain appropriate set manipulators will be provided for assisting in storage and retrieval the notion of functional documents was introduced see rfc this is to be a document whose purpose is reasonably stable over time it can have subdocuments that change more frequently a current list of functional documents includes the nic catalog directory of people resources notebook protocols and site facilities one for each site the mechanism of documentation is the responsibility of nic the document contents are the responsibility of the author there are two cases of document revision replace part of the document and replace the entire document in general nic would like the document heafner page rfc minutes of network working group meeting may to be re issued in its entirety with a new nic rather than issuing errata the functional documents are in looseleaf form new pages can be issued with the same number and a revision date documents are reproduced and mailed to site liaisons hours after receipt they are mailed to station agents on a weekly basis when mailing is handled directly by a site a copy of the document and a distribution list should also be sent to nic in the past nic has supplied abstracts of documents for the catalog nic requests that the authors include an abstract telnet the purpose of telnet is to provide an immediate mechanism for communication between keyboard terminals and serving processes with sufficient platform for later expansion and sophistication tom o sullivan described telnet as delineated in rfc later in these nwg meetings tom issued rfc a new telnet protocol after the description many issues and questions were raised viz can telnet expect recovery from ncp vs character set dle bit code vs high order bit on should protocol extend service beyond what level consoles see human factors if information is available at second level should it be passed to telnet twx like service from nic mailbox protocol etc in large part these issues were raised but not resolved it was agreed that an rfc would be forthcoming rfc published later at the meetings followed by a functional document heafner page rfc minutes of network working group meeting may iii monday afternoon session file transfer protocol rfc the file transfer protocol rfc was described see also rfc and rfc a simplified version of rfc is being implemented by mit dm and mit multics in order to allow dynamic modeling access to multics file storage facility and conduct a pilot project to gain understanding of such protocols it was noted that rfc was not simple enough to implement for tips a group was formed to meet wednesday morning for more discussion and to exactly define the problems the group would include representatives from ucla ucsb bbn mit rand sri harvard file protocol status report ucsb described the status of rfc a simple minded file system as an operational program not a proposal the basic concepts of the file system were described the design objective was to provide a simple service quickly currently one drive and pack is available at most four drives will be made available during the next year it is also not clear how long space will remain available the storage is currently free sites that will use the file system are mitre via bbn ucla sri and raytheon via one of the boston hosts miscellaneous topics sockets socket name structure was briefly discussed relevant rfcs that were mentioned were rfc whose purpose was to describe socket structures enumerated at the february nwg meetings and rfc a recently proposed structure it was pointed out that there was a definite need to reduce the socket length from to bits a tip storage problem regardless of its structure heafner page rfc minutes of network working group meeting may a committee bob metcalfe chairman with abhay bhushan and joel winett was appointed to produce a report in two weeks the committee is to address the following three issues is a socket structure needed are more than bits needed what procedures are recommended for managing socket numbers initial connection protocol race conditions and time out problems were elucidated see rfc and a committee chaired by jon postel and including steve wolfe eric harslem and arie shoshani was appointed to clean up the icp specification testing and validation sites wishing a remote partner to exchange ncp telnet and logger protocols can contact rand rand was to collect status information before and during these exercises information was to be forwarded to alex mckenzie to maintain and update status reports note a later steering committee decision reflects on the way in which this information is gathered however rand is still available for testing and validation heafner page rfc minutes of network working group meeting may iv monday evening session note minutes of this session were kindly prepared by bob walker radc operating systems and networks an attempt was made to study the arpa networks from an academic point of view an analogy was drawn on the basis that the arpa network with its hosts and protocols is in a sense an operating system and that a study of what makes a good operating system might help define what makes a good arpa network professor art j bernstein of stony brook gave a presentation abstracting what he considered to be the features of a flexible operating system the techniques for obtaining such and when appropriate a discussion of those aspects where a difference in techniques is required between dealing with an internal operating system and dealing with a network the features of a flexible operating system were cited as a flexible file structure a process hierarchy and an interprocess communication facility ipc the terminology and techniques described to obtain these three features were essentially those developed for the multics system a file structure capability was defined in terms of hierarchy of directories tree names active file table hold count known file table and reference number a process hierarchy was discussed in terms of father son relationship and a father node spawning a son node creating an entry in the known file table and assigning resources all embodied in the spawn primitive implementation of primitives as time independent was stressed as being crucial to network activity whereas not necessarily so for an internal operating system this lead into the concept subcontracting process where executive type functions are treated on the same basis as user processes and as such are swappable the link process was then described as the interface mechanism between two cooperating machines interprocess communication was discussed in terms of channels status return and software interrupts appropriate primitives were defined in detail as well as control type problems heafner page rfc minutes of network working group meeting may the discussion then went to file handling and a specification of the required primitives and thence to directory handling specification of related primitives and the mechanics of directory handling specifically the outstanding operation entry table in the executive after a short recess bob metcalfe gave a presentation from the arpa network point of view with reference to various points of professor bernstein s presentation he noted the all pervasive tree structure in bernstein s presentation which appears to be most efficient to internal operating systems i e file system process hierarchy etc but that the arpa network is not a tree structure but rather a directed graph and that we should be careful not to impose tree structure thinking on a directed graph type situation a number of questions and problem areas were elicited from the group and listed on the blackboard how much does the operating system need to know about the network to get how much and vice versa degree of transparency to the user optimal resource allocation on the network autonomy versus centralization of control resiliency the group discussed the need for a committee on theory how it should function how often should they meet requirements for attendance etc dave walden was mentioned as a possible organizer of a related effort bob metcalfe agreed to chair such a committee heafner page rfc minutes of network working group meeting may v tuesday morning session drs working group meeting with open attendance the purpose of the data reconfiguration service meeting was to resolve several lingering syntax and semantics issues and also to receive comments and discuss the drs with the entire net community a brief overview of the drs see rfc was given remaining technical issues were resolved an implementation specification replacing rfc will be issued soon initial implementers and users were polled for schedules and initial experiments results are shown below mit no dates currently provided u of ill one or two months will be required to reformat from remote formats to gould printer also conversion of ards to computec strings ucsb implementation of service in two months will provide system forms for remote tty like devices to access ucsb on line system mitre will compare performance of drs to current software of ucsb file experiment rand implement service by september initial use to specify ucsb rje rj and ucla netrjs formats for local users ucla will have a compiler of forms within one month unless serious difficulties arise data management on computer networks sdc presented rfc see also rfc arie shoshani presented considerations and approaches that can be taken to achieve data sharing the considerations were common language sharing of existing data evolutionary revolutionary future and use facility further development implementation and speed approaches given were centralized a new data only b existing data standardized data integrated common languages interfaces a interface on different nodes b interface on service node c data reconfiguration service unified heafner page rfc minutes of network working group meeting may dick winter described the cca approach with several data computers it becomes decentralized all data computers have identical hardware and software their objective is to dispose and restructure data throughout the net to optimize its use i e relocate it close to where it is used most heavily for small files of wide interest multiple copies can be maintained dr roberts commented that with respect to the network no distance cost relationship exists if data is retrieved more than one link away the reason for putting files in several places is reliability he views the cca approach as a net level language thus the unified approach also the natural language approach is suitable as a research project but not suitable for data management for real net experiments cca will present a proposal of data language at the next nwg meeting open discussion on data management this time period was initially allocated to the description of a particular data management system being constructed by mitre it became in fact an open discussion of general principles and requirements for data management in the network the following were among the most recurrent comments made drs file protocol and data management should be examined in a comprehensive way important considerations of data management are to allow users to define and restructure files logically to move towards transparency of the net and to move toward natural language a data management system should include functions for define access manipulate analyze store of files for example the data computer doesn t do formatting for output like an rpg it can take a number of conditions and do conditional retrieval but not rpg a data management system could be developed in stages where a the user explicitly moves data around the net b the user specifies the location but the access is integrated automatically c location is maintained by the service an area should be defined between file handling and application specific manipulation and the area should be treated in a system wide way heafner page rfc minutes of network working group meeting may the super file too large for any one individual to economically own never came up before but it is reasonable for the net however it is just one use and there still will be need of many files privacy and security criteria should be applied at output rather than input which is an argument for having processing capability at the location of the file dr roberts indicated that the things that are important are what things are on the net and what things are there to say the structure depends on what there is to say thus one should concentrate on the language and not the structure the data management system can be viewed as having two parts the request the response and format on the response side operand side there is the taxonomy of data types and a template of data followed by the data a template is a string in which data types or their descriptions are given with knowledge of iteration recursion and data types on the request operator side templates can be used to precisely specify the data to be retrieved assuming the structure of the file is already specified the disposition and request are over structures to the response a small group was established to continue discussion on data management heafner page rfc minutes of network working group meeting may vi tuesday evening session terminal imp the tip can either be configured with one host and two phone lines or three phone lines interfaces will provide kb to lowest tty speeds for each line it can handle various terminals and devices normally the user speaks through the tip but a primitive language exists for talking to the tip commands will exist to do the particular protocols such as logger other commands will be present for terminate on line feed on character now on nth char at end of message i e class of things to determine when message is sent there is another class to determine echoing device rates can be set up the serving site can also set up command such as capturing a printer the tip is currently trying to comply with all second and third level protocols such as telnet file transfer when defined current plans are that the tip cannot be reloaded through the network when new terminals are added bbn will supply the tip routines as part of the service the tip is intended to be used for rje terminal to process and later tape to tape the tip is intended to be a switch rather than an operating system under the assumption that power will reside in terminals and service centers the program limits the bandwidth the sum of input and output is kb potential for tip delivery is about one every three weeks after august an upper figure for the tip is k the leasable terms are k yr for three years plus a residual of k to own it with a two year minimum this was designed as an alternate method of purchase comments by dr roberts the major cost benefit in the near term to getting on the network will be to use other physical systems to access new resources it will be a number of years before people enter the network in order to get rid of machines or to boost cpu usage heafner page rfc minutes of network working group meeting may regarding future network growth the university of california has proposed to enter seven universities into the network we should have the data and program sharing protocols fixed by that time etac will be working on the past years weather in store ncar will be trading time a and a with them and with illiac use is restricted to weather work january or february are probable dates this will be a third cross country connection through utah perhaps second is via omaha weather sc will be added in march or april for picture processing england will join about february there are other plans to tie in mexico france israel australia japan hawaii canada etc that could possibly all happen in with regard to operating the network arpa will not operate it indefinitely one plan is to have at t operate it since they can legally sell the services this will not come about soon a commercial organization not a common carrier can only operate the net under government sponsorship the current plan is to have bbn run the net as a service for the government this will be settled within the coming year on the question of resources setting up contracts with the service people at each site to get one agent to ship money for various subcontracts is a basic legal framework for arpa purposes it is sufficient to have only one connection with each site on software development the ncp progress has been extremely poor and slow the second iteration should have been defined by now from experiences with the first towards the end of the year a new protocol should be defined to last for a couple of years accounting and billing protocol should also be defined the ncp protocol is getting to be a critical problem everyone should be complete and consistent with the current protocol by july without it there will be serious problems of bringing new people onto the net for example the i and the laser store will be on the net by march or april of with serious people wanting to use it of its use will be remote by early the net must be a solid working entity the question of profit making time sharing companies on the net depends on whether or not at t takes over net operations the capital arrangement for non arpa users to be on the net is as follows a federal agency can donate k and get a tip non federal agencies can pay k per year for the tip for three years plus the k residual to own it arpa will not decide casually to allow non federal agencies on heafner page rfc minutes of network working group meeting may regarding software support services documentation will be upgraded so all sites need not keep complete nic documentation except service sites in service centers it makes sense to add one or two personnel to work on net service programs work with users etc if needed research centers will now have to concern themselves with reliability integrity and problems of access regarding the charging mechanism for the data computer the store cost one million plus the cost of the pdp thus cents bit is reasonable for permanent storage the rate for short term storage strips like two weeks will be about the same if medium term storage is needed a rate will be worked out arpa will pay for this storage as backup for the sites the on lineness of nic is very important for initial use but we must have something better than tty or crt the net is cheaper than the mails electrostatic hard copy devices were briefly mentioned regarding new developments for ai symbolic processing a plan hatched by alan kay is to have lots of processor lots of core and a big switch with the capability of serving users in the net it is to provide low cost core space economics of processing are not known this may become associated with some experimental hardware development facility since the desire is to be able to build new architecture in a reasonable amount of time it should be to times faster than the pdp with earliest delivery in the speech effort is on the order of three million per year the concern now is to be able to tie together pieces at various sites for comparative evaluation the cross testing can have an impact on the researcher but everybody must maintain compatible interfaces the climatology program is for predicting future long range climate of the world that comes about by perturbations various sites are involved at various levels and it is hard to get these people to big computers to the data bases and with each other the network provides their total communication path with the i direct and effective use of the network can be made without much more of an investment the rand ucsb work is a good example heafner page rfc minutes of network working group meeting may vii wednesday morning session this session began with discussion of file transfer protocol led by abhay bhusan it was decided that the current file transfer protocol should be parsed into two pieces a data transfer protocol front end that could be used for file transfer and other protocols and the file mechanism protocol this problem was referred to the committee which met for the remainder of the day to specify the data transfer and file protocols an rfc will be forth coming describing these protocols the data management group met in parallel wednesday an rfc will be forthcoming on their results heafner page rfc minutes of network working group meeting may viii wednesday evening session the following information was summarized by steve crocker committees
