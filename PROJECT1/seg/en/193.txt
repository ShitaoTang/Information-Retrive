 nwg rfc michael d kudlick mdk sri arc nic mar network mail meeting summary introduction the purpose of this rfc is to briefly summarize from the nic s viewpoint the principal conclusions reached at the network mail meeting held friday february at sri arc please refer to rfc nic for abhay bhushan s comprehensive summary of the issues discussed at the meeting there is no major disagreement between the present rfc and rfc rfc nic contains background information on the meeting rfc nic describes what the nic would like to see included in the file transfer protocol for network mail purposes and also describes briefly how the nic would use the information the present rfc is organized as follows conclusions discussion attendees conclusions additional ftp mail requirements were decided upon these would be implemented as a new mail command with the following subcommands to this field is explicitly allowed to contain multiple addressees with a standard syntax user host from this field provides a return address for notification of undeliverable mail as well as a clearcut identification of the sender for the recipient s information page nic mdk mar author this field denotes the author of the mail there may be multiple authors title the title i e subject of the mail is to be terminated by period carriage return acknowledegment success failure time out normal for use by the intermediate host probably the nic in most cases to tell the sender what happened to his attempt to send mail note normal wasn t defined recorded jnumber null note jnumber is the pre assigned accession number nic number to be used when known the recorded subcommand provides for the option of having the mail recorded information given with this subcommand would be recognized at the nic options are to be recorded in nic journal only to be recorded and distributed to be distributed only this field would also be used to inform the recipient that the mail has been recorded in retrospect it may be preferable to have a separate command to inform the recipient of this fact but no decision on this was made at the feb meeting type long urgent ordinary this allows the recipient site to take whatever action it thinks appropriate in storing the mail text file citation text this field is for the text of the mail message page nic mdk mar file the purpose of the field is unclear to me does it contain a machine readable pointer to the file that the sender wishes the recipient to read citation this field is a person readable pointer to the file that the sender wishes the recipient to read when the citation command is used no mail is sent other than the citation discussion introduction the key aspects in the solution are it is based on ftp it uses the nic without requiring direct use of nls there is a mechanism for uniformity in the use of user identifications there is a mechanism for recording the mail for later reference these issues are covered in the discussion that follows new ftp mail subcommands to addressee format the standard form of the address is user host user may be an individual s last name or it may be whatever other identification the recipient has chosen and has made known to the rest of the network if the intended host doesn t recognize the intended recipient s identification then it sends back an undeliverable mail message to the sender s host it is up to the individual to keep the nic informed of his wherabouts sic otherwise he may not get his mail on time page nic mdk mar nic role the nic need have no role at all for mail sent from point a to point b whenever that mail is not to be recorded at the nic for mail that is to be recorded at the nic the recorded subcommand is to be used also when the sender does not know the standard address of the recipients he may use the nic to obtain this information idents and addresses the nic will modify its identification files to include the user host standard address for each individual sites may ask the nic to translate from nic ident or from a user s last name to the standard address a query facility will be made available at the nic to do the translation on request the translation service will also be available for group idents this service would be ftp like in term of the prootocol sic it accepts but would not be within ftp itself a different server process would handle ident translation requests translation will also be done at the nic when the nic is used as an intermediate point on the delivery route the nic could be an intermediate point for recording the mail as a nic journal item and for forwarding the mail to its ultimate destinations during this process the nic would translate from nic idents to standard addresses in the nic ident files provision already exists to specify hardcopy or on line delivery of recorded nic journal mail this provision will be extended to include a network attribute which means deliver the mail to the host of this person the network attribute may be qualified by restricting all mail to be kept at the sender with only a notification message actually mailed page nic mdk mar notification would be in the form of a citation giving to from title date of submission and location of mail tip users to enable tip users to have access to the mail system both for sending and receiving mail it was suggested that some hosts will have to be the home site for these users but no more than one home site per user that is an account that allows a tip user to send and receive mail will have to be established at such a host for the present any tip user can use the sri arc system for his mail requirements an alternate solution that tip s be equipped with a hardcopy device that is continuously available for printing mail was discarded in favor of the above approach from the from command in ftp identifies the sender in standard address form this will allow undeliverable mail notices to be sent back to the originator the default condition is that the sender s host must retain the mail until it is delivered to the recipient s host delivered means that the recipient s host has accepted the mail it does not mean that the recipient has read the mail alternatively the sender may designate that an intermediate host store the mail then the intermediate host has the responsibility of storing the mail until it is delivered to all intended recipients the acknowledgement command will allow an optional positive acknowledgement to be given to the originator of the mail the from addressee stating that the mail was delivered page nic mdk mar author the author may be several persons for recorded documents the authors appear separately in the index of authors to facilitate searching for mail when an author is known but the title and location of the mail are unknown title the title field is especially useful for recorded mail since indexes on key words in the title can be produced relatively easily and facilitate searching for mail for this reason the title should be a succinct indicator of the contents acknowledgement acknowledgement of failure to deliver should be given to the sender an optional positive acknowledgement of successful delivery to the recipient s sitename will be given on request of sender like u s certified mail no acknowledgement that the recipient actually saw the mail will be given comparable to not having u s registered mail recorded the concept of recorded mail is that a permanent record of the mail is kept centrally to allow future references and re readings of the mail to be made for example in the nic journal system a record is kept of all the items entered into the journal from this record author title word and nic number indexes are produced to allow for references and re readings the key to retrieval of recorded journal items is the use of an accession number the nic number this essentially removes the possibility of duplicate filenames being used the basic aspect of recorded mail which was discussed at the mail meeting is the assignment of an accession number page nic mdk mar it was decided to get the accession numbers from the nic on an as needed basis without pre assignment and without local assignment of numbers this subject may be reviewed in the future local assignment may be desirable to prevent the nic from becoming a bottleneck in the mail process it was pointed out that local assignment of numbers would be un ambiguous if the numbers included some information such as sitename date and time one other problem exits sic namely where is the recorded document initially the document should be in the nic but ultimately it could be anywhere on the network provided only that there is a central mechanism for indexing and cataloging all the recorded documents the pathname to the recorded document would then include filename and sitename type the type subcommand was a result of a discussion on the problems of large mail files and the associated question of who would pay for the processing and storing of these files the main decisions made were a the processing transmittal and storage costs of sending mail should be borne at the sender s host b the processing and storage costs of receiving mail should be borne at the recipient s host initially as a default information to enable the recipient host to make an intelligent decision about where to store the incoming mail are passed along via the type command the recipient host will have the local option of providing either of the following services page nic mdk mar a free use of system to send mail b free use of system to receive mail i e login not required for delivery over the network a possible alternative is use of a mail account or use of the recipient s account for processing and storage of the incoming mail text file citation text this field is for the text of the mail message file the purpose of this field is unclear to me does it contain a machine readable pointer to the file that the sender wishes the recipient to read citation the citation is a person readable pointer to the file that the sender wishes the recipient to read an alternative to sending entire messages or files over the network is to use the citation mechanism with this the sender sends a short message the citation saying in effect please read file x at site y this alternative would be especially useful for a mail that is distributed with group idents to all liaisons for example and b long files size not defined that the recipient may not be immediately interested in however no method of enforcing use of this alternative was discussed it will be up to the recipients to devise a scheme satisfactory to them other general discussion bob kahn placed on the floor the following question i paraphrase can t the design of a mail system be made to include alternative sources of data and alternative modes of operation unless exclusion of these alternatives can be quantitatively defended page nic mdk mar particular aspects of this question are what is the desirability and difficulty of admitting different data sources into the mail system what are the boundaries that divide permitted from prohibited data sources what is the quantitative distinction between deferred and realtime mail will the design we come up with allow such things as a handling a calendar that reflects the known and anticipated whereabouts of people so that meetings can be scheduled sensibly b formatting the mail contents for later query and other information handling whatever primitives we implement can t they be designed so as not to preclude things like tenex linking this requires two way data communication paths how do we specify and get the attention of a sink for the data stream e g for interprocess communication and for tenex type linking the general reaction to this discussion was one of perspective in the scheme of things that could be considered point to point communication mailbox type of communication is not the most general kind akb listed several types of communication problems program program communication people people real time communication e g tenex type links computer teleconferencing mailbox communication cataloging storage protocols host host telnet file transfer page nic mdk mar a design for a mailbox type system won t be required to encompass the problems of say a computer teleconferencing system which has attributes real time video very large volume of data to be transferred to name some that are not attributes of a mail box
