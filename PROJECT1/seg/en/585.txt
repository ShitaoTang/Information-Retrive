 network working group david c walden rfc bbn net nic january updates scheduled network software maintenance as explained in rfc we believe that we can minimize the disruption caused by the release of new imp software systems by doing them on a regularly scheduled basis in the past we have reserved the one hour period from am until am every tuesday morning for our imp system scheduled software maintenance period as the size of the network has grown to about forty imps we find we can no longer complete a system release to all imps in the one hour scheduled therefore we are extending our scheduled software maintenance period to two hours from am until am eastern time every tuesday morning the extended period will take effect as of the first tuesday in february as we said in rfc we will not always use the tuesday morning period but we always reserve it on tuesday mornings when we do use the scheduled software maintenance period a type imp to host message will be sent to all hosts about an hour in advance of the period we understand that the software maintenance period cannot continue to grow linearly with the number of imps and we will find a way around this problem before software releases start taking hours a week an imp going down for scheduled software maintenance message this rfc was put into machine readable form for entry into the online rfc archives by alex mckenzie with support from gte formerly bbn corp walden page
