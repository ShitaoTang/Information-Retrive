material has not been reviewed for public release and is intended only for use with the arpa network it should not be quoted or cited in any publication not related to the arpa network to nic from joel m winnet ll subject conventions for using an ibm terminal as a user console for access to network server hosts an ibm terminal can be used to key in different codes these include graphics plus the controls sp bs ht and nl each of these have defined ascii codes except the cent graphic and the new line control nl when the nl character is keyed the program receiving the keyboard input can translate this signal into the appropriate line end signal for the host which is being used that is to a nl cr or lf code whichever is appropriate there are other ascii graphic characters and other ascii controls which cannot be keyed on a terminal a convention must be established so that all ascii codes can be keyed from a terminal this requires that one character be chosen as an escape or prefix character which a together with following characters can be converted into any desired ascii code in addition to this escape character there are three other functions which are usually indicated by the typing of a single character key these are a character delete to cause this character and the preceding character in the input line to be deleted b line delete to cause this character and all previous characters in the current input line to be deleted c logical line end to cause all characters keyed after the last logical line end character or last nl character up to this character to be considered as one logical line with this character being treated as if the nl key were entered characters following the logical line end character up to another logical line end character or a nl character are used for form another input line winett page rfc conventions for using an ibm march since characters keyed are normally sent to the server host a method must be defined to allow characters keyed to be interpreted by the user program a system escape character can be used for this purpose on character at a time systems the characters keyed between two system escape characters can be interpreted by the user program on line at a time systems characters keyed after the system escape character and up to and including a nl character can be interpreted by the user program lines interpreted by the user program are not sent to the server host for those host systems which require use of the ins or inr network control commands a method must be defined for causing these commands to be sent these can be sent on a command to the user program either after keying the system escape character or through the use of the attention button on a terminal this choice will depend on the characteristics of the terminal user s operating system other commands to the user program might be to a suppress typeout of received messages b restore typeout of received messages c direct received message to a disk file d direct keyed input to a disk file e abort the user program the following characters are recommended for the special functions listed above character escape not system escape
