 network working group d meyer request for comments sri arc nic july network journal submission and delivery augmentation research center stanford research center menlo park california the on line documentation will be maintained as userguides journal netsub hard copies are available from marcia keeney the first implementation of a network journal submission and delivery system is now experimentally up this system allows use of the nic s nls journal system without entering nls network users may submit text files written on their host systems using their mail subsystems e g sndmsg ftp telnet the mail will then be converted at sri arc into nls files journalized and sent to the specified recipients according to their preset journal delivery options a newly added option permits the user to receive automatic journal delivery of citations to journalized documents at his host via the network mail protocol overview network mail sent to sri arc nic will be entered into the nic journal system if a slash appears in the user name to get the mail to the nic you may use either the ftp telnet or mail subsystem provided by your local system the author s nic ident s are assumed to appear before the slash the recipients nic ident s after it idents should be separated by spaces see scenarios in branch e g jew mdk dhc meyer page rfc network journal submission and delivery july when this format is detected by the nic the network journal system will be invoked at sri arc the mail will be transformed into an nls file assigned a unique catalog number stored permanently under that number and a notice of it will be sent to all the listed recipients if the slash is not found the mail will be handled in the normal way delivery of journal citations may now be obtained via the network as well as to an nls file at sri arc and in hard copy if you wish to receive your journal mail at you host computer contact the nic see rfc a more detailed description follows network journal submission the remote user prepares the text of his journal article in his host using whatever tools he has available to him he may wish to prepare long articles beforehand using his text editor e g teco if he s a tenex user for short messages he may be content with the basic editing features such as backspace character and line delete provided by his submission subsystem connecting to the nic to get the mail to the sri arc ftp server you must either via ftp and telnet mail subsystems connect to sri arc s ftp server process then issue the ftp mail command or use the mail subsystem provided by your local system for tenex sndmsg mail put nic at the end of the user field e g jew mdk dhc nic if you wish to send the mail as a sndmsg message to some people as well as submit it to the journal you may treat the journal form as one name follow it with a comma and then list other names of which sndmsg is aware separated by commas e g jew mdk dhc nic meyer white specifying authors and recipients the user invokes network journal submission via his mail subsystem network journal submission is invoked by a user name field of the following format meyer page rfc network journal submission and delivery july author sp author sp sp recipient sp recipient sp conversion algorithm means any number of occurrences possibly zero of what s inside the parentheses sp means space mean the contents of the brackets are optional i e author s slash recipient s optional semicolon and conversion algorithm e g jew mdk rww cr dcs rww jcn sri arc h author is the nic ident of one of the user s submitting the article and recipient the ident of one of its intended recipient s an ident as usual may designate either a group or an individual sri arc will verify the idents if it finds them correct it will accept the mail an invalid ident will cause the mail to be rejected the user will get an error message and have to start over the first author ident will be taken to be the clerk if the sri arc mail subsystem finds the slash in the user name field the network journal submission system will be invoked otherwise the mail will be treated as normal network mail delivered to the directory specified by the user name specifying an nls conversion algorithm optionally the sender may specify the algorithm by which his sequential message file is to be converted to nls format this choice is made by inserting conversion algorithm anywhere in the user name field e g jew mdk rww s this should be before the nic for sndmsg legal values for conversion algorithm are s insert sequential each line an nls statement default conversion algorithm a insert assembler with structure m insert assembler without structure h heuristic insert sequential double s indicating end of statements assuming no right justification in the source file meyer page rfc network journal submission and delivery july j heuristic insert sequential double s indicating end of statements assuming right justification in the source file for those who put multiple spaces between words to line up the right margin multiple spaces will be removed by heuristic insert sequential we mean that the insert sequential algorithm attempts to be smarter about handling statements and levels statements are delimited by two successive carriage returns statement level will be determined by the amount the statement is indented if it is indented more than the previous statement it will be taken to be a substatement and put down a level if it is the same as the previous statement it will be on the same level if the statement is indented less than the previous statement the program will look for a past statement with the same indentation and put it at that level the indentation of a statement is taken to be that of either the first or second line of the statement whichever is less to ignore paragraph indentation for example this is good from to levels carriage returns at the end of full within characters of the right margin i e nd column lines are replaced by spaces this algorithm is an attempt to answer a very difficult need it won t always do just the right thing but it should often provide the intended result the user is encouraged to experiment with it suggestions will be welcomed titling the message once the conversion has been performed an optional title signaled by the label re title or subject is searched for in the first statement of the message text the label may either be all upper or all lower case or the first character upper and the rest lower case if a label is found anywhere in the statement the line of that statement beginning with the first non blank character following the label and going up to the first carriage return and line feed or else to the end of the statement is taken as the journal title and the statement containing the title is deleted from the file any substructure will be moved up a level the submission is equivalent to the nls submit message command if th nls file after the title statement if any has been deleted has only one statement in it besides the origin statement in such a case the message in its entirety will be delivered as part of the journal citation otherwise the network submission is equivalent to submit file only a reference to the journal document will be meyer page rfc network journal submission and delivery july delivered to each of the recipients tenex scenarios if you re a tenex user you can do network journal submission with any of the following subsystems system responses are in square brackets sndmsg the header and

are currently available to nls users each user can select any one or a combination of ways of receiving journal mail online an entry containing the text of the mail or for longer items a citation to it made in the user s initial file which resides in his directory at sri arc meyer page rfc network journal submission and delivery july hardcopy the text of the mail is sent to the user i e to an address of his choosing via the u s postal service network journal mail will be delivered to a user via the net to a host and mailbox of his choosing if you wish this option let the nic know and give them the name of your host and mailbox short messages submit message will be delivered in their entirety to the remote user preceded by the usual sort of header giving author date and time citation

scenario location sri arc nlsxnls in place of the usual link which appears in online delivery is a host name sri arc and a pathname to the file at the host using it the remote user or a process running on his behalf can fetch a copy of the file from sri arc ftp the parameter xnls signals sri arc s ftp server process to convert the nls file to sequential form using a default conversion algorithm before transmission to the user through the net by network journal delivery mail will be delivered via ftp mail command to a host i e to it s ftp server process and mailbox address of the

submission and delivery described here is a first cut a more flexible and slightly cleaner user interface will be fashioned when the file transfer protocol ftp upon which both implementations will rely is revised to deal more comprehensibly with the issue of mail delivery forwarding and recording see rfc this rfc was put into machine readable form for entry into the online rfc archives by via
