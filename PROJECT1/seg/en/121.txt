 nwg rfc ucsb computer nic research laboratory roland f bryan february exercising the arpanet questions can a technically competent person initially uninformed as to network operation and naive as to the capabilities of various time shared terminal systems attached to the network be able to develop problem solving competence at server sites on the arpanet what inherent user problems exist that complicate such adaptation once proficient in the use what aspects of the various sites limit the usability and what modifications should be considered at both server and user sites to meet various needs should a user select a given site for composing and editing all of his files for subsequent transfer to other sites for processing or should he learn to compose and edit at each of the sites doing his processing what are the problems in starting cooperating processes at several sites how does a user control such processes page obtaining the answers under the direction of ucsb professor james howard a test group of graduate students was formed to pursue the questions above and any other aspect of arpanet operation that they might uncover the test group has been given access to the console on line system classroom in the e e department at ucsb the consoles produce graphic and alphanumeric displays and are tied into the ucsb host which gains them access to the network old style culler fried keyboards are being used which provide a limited key set jim white has managed to program around most of the protocol problems brought about by these keyboards but some still remain seminars were given to the test group to familiarize them with software and hardware aspects of the arpanet the local nic file has been made available to the group and the group has been allowed to sign onto the network to pursue any available system following the initial period of two weeks during which the group developed some familiarity with the network the test group has been divided into working groups with emphasis as follows patric timlick bbn tenex dave stearns bbn tenex b john pickens sri arc nic doug beaubien dave whittington richard haraguchi mit multics maria degraaf mit dmcg richard melton su sung won ronald varekamp jeoff benson ucla ccn harv hasan a el hasan ucla nmc utah george engelberg rand csg ll rodney skinner page some initial results the first real encounters with the arpanet at large produced a series of questions and comments test group comments are itemized below with additional comments by the author in braces we plan subsequent reports on a periodic basis we find that we need further information about access to the ncps at various sites user manuals from the sites might provide this site response is solicited we sometimes cannot sign into ucla nmc directly from ucsb but can do so readily by way of bbn protocol after running a fortran or pl program at some net location we can only display the results on our consoles but cannot store them as files ucsb programming need when communications break down how can a user be assured that he is logged out of some remote site need for automatic log out how do we make contact with programmers at other sites to develop cooperative programs for file transfer etc jim white is there a best time of day for operation at each site should contact be made with the site operator prior to user sessions server sites please comment ucla nmc has assigned a separate user identification for test group use would other sites prefer to do likewise comments is there information regarding uses made of the various time shared systems by internal users at each site does a bibliography exist to allow contact with such users check the resource notebook mit dmcg and bbn provide very good user service especially the site survey also these sites have good responses to define events can ucsb provide local users with similar information jim white this rfc was put into machine readable form for entry into the online rfc archives by bbn corp under the direction of alex mckenzie page
