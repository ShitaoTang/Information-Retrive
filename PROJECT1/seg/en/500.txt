 network working group robert t braden rfc ucla ccn nic april on mail service to ccn most of the recent documents on mail protocols have discussed the facilities desired at post office hosts i e those which provide store and forward services ccn has no plans to provide post office services we expect to receive mail only for the staff of ccn our greatest concern is to get messages reliably to and from our administrative and user support people who don t habitually use on line terminals so we are printing out all mail and distributing it by courier secretary let me say a friendly word for sndmsg this tenex command which uses the ftp mail command to deliver messages is very simple but extremely useful probably because it is so simple furthermore it is one of the well kept secrets of the network that sndmsg can be used to send messages to any host which supports the mail command without requiring logon to ftp thus to send a message to anyone at ccn the recommended procedure is to do sndmsg to name ccn this connects to ccn s ftp and sends a mail name command followed by the message we now accept any name and print an immediate upper case copy which is distributed to the recipient s office so if you sndmsg to braden ccn your message will end up on my desk usually within a few hours other useful sndmsg destination at ccn are wbk ccn or kehl ccn the director rib ccn or bell ccn supervisor of user relations bbn ccn or noble ccn barbara noble user consultant this fine service is brought to you by your friendly neighborhood tenex on the other hand the tenex readmail command is a little too simple after giving you a message it should ask you whether you want to delete keep forward and or repeat the message dave crocker of nmc has suggested an extension to the mail and mlfl mail file commands in ccn s ftp to allow ccn to serve as a mail delivery station for nmc as well as ccn this extension is intended to be a trivial subset of the full blown mail protocol which is currently being developed by jim white et al it is a simple means to allow ccn s high speed printers to be used conveniently for receiving and braden page rfc on mail service to ccn april disseminating network documentation as well as messages it is based upon extensions of the pathname user name fields in the mlfl mail commands respectively the proposed syntax is as follows d document m message c copies bin the semantics would be will normally be a valid tso userid this will be used to determine a charge number to account for the printing if is not recognized the rest of the parameters will be ignored but the mail will still be accepted the result will be to print one copy immediately in upper case and send it to bin charging it to an overhead account message means print a copy immediately using the normal upper case only train this is the default document means enqueue the text for overnight printing with an upper lower case print train a message indicating receipt and perhaps the first block will also be printed immediately in upper case and distributed copies makes multiple copies this facility will not be available immediately bin specifies ccn bin to receive output default will be arpa mail bin each incoming message will be time and date stamped the time date will appear on the first page of the message on a separate page in the case of upper lowercase in the acknowledgment message from ftp and on our system log file this time date stamp may be useful for users to keep tabs on their documents and to allow us to track down missing messages the semicolon and equal sign delimiters of this syntax are acceptable in the user parameter to sndmsg this extended mail syntax will be implemented by june rtb gjm braden page rfc on mail service to ccn april this rfc was put into machine readable form for entry into the online rfc archives by alex mckenzie with support from gte formerly bbn corp braden page
