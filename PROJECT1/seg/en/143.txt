 network working group james e white jew request for comments sri arc nic march use of ftp by the nic journal at the network mail meeting see the nic outlined it s requirements for implementing ftp journal delivery and submission it had always been our thinking that those two services should rely upon the file transfer protocol s mlfl command for their implementation prior to the meeting we had envisioned that in the case of submission for example the user would embed what parameters the nic required e g an indication that this piece of mail was to be journalized a list of nic idents etc in the username field of the mlfl command in a way that was transparent to his ftp user process and that sri arc s ftp server process would parse the user name for the parameters and internally invoke the journal system with them and the text of the mail as arguments our goal which this scheme would have satisfied was to provide the desired services while confining software changes to our own system and in particular to avoid requiring that user ftp processes or the file transfer protocol itself be modified it was however the consensus of those present at the meeting that it was preferable to modify ftp in such a way that all required parameters could be explicitly declared rather than require that they be hidden within what purported to be simply a user name the intent of this rfc is to list what we the nic believe were the new ftp commands it was agreed should be defined in support of mail submission and delivery actually we ve done some massaging after thinking about the issues for awhile and so this is really a description of what we d like to see included in the file transfer protocol following the lines of thought which developed at the meeting along with a short description of how the nic would use them some of the commands currently make sense only if issued to the nic s ftp server process as opposed to anybody else s and others only if issued by the nic s ftp user process as opposed to anybody else s this is true because currently only the nic plans to offer mail white page rfc use of ftp by the nic journal march forwarding and recording i e the journal system as a service however other hosts may in the future desire to implement a similar service at which time these special commands will have wider use conceptually all of these commands are sub commands of a new mail command but the intent for the moment is not to define their position within the ftp dialogue nor their syntax but simply to describe them conceptually details of syntax and use are left to the ftp interest group which meets mar in boston see the new sub commands are described below bracketed fields are optional slash denotes a choice of two or more alternatives title title where title is a character string describing for the human reader the contents of the mail user readable author author where author identifies the author of the mail to the human reader this may be a nickname or any other identifier with which the human sender chooses to sign his mail process readable author last first initial ident where the author s name and ident if known is made available to the server in a form it can hope to parse if need be this sub command is important to the nic providing a basis for locating the author in the nic s ident files for acknowledgment author username hostname where username and hostname define the sender in a way useful in acknowledging delivery of forwarded mail the acknowledgment will itself be a piece of mail sent from the nic to username at hostname it s important conceptually to note the nic s unique role here normally acceptance of the mail by the server would constitute acknowledgment of delivery but in the case of journal submission the nic acts only as a forwarding agent and hence delivery of mail by the sender to sri arc isn t white page rfc use of ftp by the nic journal march really delivery at all only submission final delivery occurs when the nic transmits a copy of the mail to each of its addressees hence the need for this special kind of acknowledgment note that this sub command and the previous two constitute different renderings of the sender s name acknowledgment details default completion failure periodic interval giveup time terse verbose the value of the first parameter ignoring default for the moment determines the conditions under which acknowledgment will be made to the sender upon completion whether delivery was successful or timed out for one or more addressees only if delivery failed for one or more addressees or periodically until delivery is complete the value of the second parameter determines the time after which delivery attempts will be discontinued the value of the third parameter determines how detailed in some as yet unspecified sense an acknowledgment will be returned a verbose acknowledgment might in the case of delivery failure include a copy of the text of the message or for mail sent by citation see item below a pointer to it if default is specified in which case for acknowledgment author should not be specified and default applies to it too the nic will extract a set of default values from its ident files provided that a process readable author subcommand is present and the sender s nic ident can be inferred from it otherwise the nic will apply a set of as yet unspecified system defaults the nic s ident files will be modified to contain for each user known to it the kind of acknowledgment the user usually wants i e his default and the username and hostname that define the destination for such acknowledgments these last two pieces of information will white page rfc use of ftp by the nic journal march also be used in delivering mail to the user if he has requested network delivery as opposed to online at the nic or hardcopy addressees are name name this sub command identifies the recipient s of the mail in general namei will be the name by which the recipient is known locally in the server s system the nic s server ftp process will permit namei to be any of the following a nic ident designating either an individual or a group username hostname where username is the name by which the addressee is known at host hostname or lastname firstname initial which the nic will attempt to parse and then locate in its ident files note that now the possibility of multiple addressees is explicitly admitted by the protocol but the meaning of useri to the server is left server dependent mail class bulk postcard special delivery first class the first parameter makes a statement about the size of the mail and the server may choose to use it to decide how and where to store he mail for the addressee the second parameter makes a statement about the importance of the mail and the server may choose to expedite delivery e g interrupt the user if he s logged in for special delivery mail record identifier miscellaneous this is the command to the server to record the mail identifier allows the sender the option of specifying a pre assigned identifier if he has one if this field is not present the server assigns one miscellaneous includes any server dependent parameters which the server may require or allow white page rfc use of ftp by the nic journal march when this command is issued to the nic it will be taken as a command to journalize the mail and identifier may be nic number rfc number the nic may allow miscellaneous to contain such information as comments keywords etc preserved at hostname as identifier this is not a command but a statement of fact which the ftp server will presumably relay to the user as it does the information contained in for example the title command the implication is that a copy of this piece of mail has been preserved at hostname and is retrievable on a long term basis with identifier identifier might in general be a pathname when the nic delivers journal articles through the net it will include this sub command and identifier will be a nic number and hostname of course sri arc or nic text text file pathname hostname one of these two sub commands is used to actually transmit the mail the first transmits the text of the mail the second a pointer to it leaving open to the ftp server or his user the option of retrieving the text of the mail from the specified host the nic will transmit mail created within nls with submit file using the file command and mail created with submit message using the text command for mail entering the sri arc system via its ftp server process the nic will employ the same command in delivery as was used in submission this rfc was put into machine readable form for entry into the online rfc archives by hannes faestermann white page
