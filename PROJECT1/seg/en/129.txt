 network working group e harslem rand request for comments ucsb nic september category d updates rfc rand ucsb network graphics experiment introduction during the network graphics meeting in july several experiments were outlined to explore graphics over the network one of these was the use of the ucsb on line system ols from graphic consoles at rand the connection was completed in the latter half of august and has been used on an experimental basis since then ols users from ucsb and trw in los angeles have visited rand and accessed ols via rand consoles and the network thus the first phase of the experiment was completed in august we are still in the midst of the second phase of the experiment which involves cleaning up the initial implementation and reviewing and modifying our initial strategies for the ols connection implementation of the experiment ucsb ucsb has had a network interface on the ols for some time for a description see rfc the descriptions in rfc were modified to conform to current network protocols ncp and icp and to conform to what we considered a general graphics description basically the ols receives an ebcdic like input byte stream and generates an unstructured graphical output stream these protocols will be documented at the completion of our experimentation and presented at the network graphics meeting in october the rand video graphics system vgs was used to access the ols via the network the video graphics system and its consoles are described in r arpa available from the rand reports department vgs consoles had been connected previously to the network via the rand network services program nsp originally nsp was designed to afford ncp checkout features logging in to and use of remote systems and access to ucsb rje and ucla rjs an additional module was easily added to access the ols stoughton page rfc rand ucsb network graphics experiment september input to the ols was done via a rand tablet on a vgs console input to the ols module in nsp is accomplished by moving the tablet cursor not shown in the attached figures which appears as a small dot on the screen to the desired function button and pressing the tablet pen down on the tablet figure shows the initial display from the ols module the top of the screen has a feedback line the remainder of the upper half is the output display from the ols and the lower half is a large sensitive area containing various function buttons pic table the sensitive areas fall into three classes the right most column call close connects disconnects to ols over the network the third function copy generates hardcopy via an sc the figures are in fact sc hardcopy the grid area contains the ols function buttons normally on a special function keyboard see rfc the lower area allows entry of number characters and punctuation figure shows the login sequence to ols and figure sin and cos curves from pi to pi generated by ols completion of the experiment we plan to present the experiment at the october graphics meeting in two forms first a description of the protocols and techniques used in implementing the remote network connection along with conclusions second we will make a film showing the use of the ols from rand and present it at the meeting stoughton page rfc rand ucsb network graphics experiment september ucsb ols init stats feed back ols dis play area i ii iii iv v vi vii rel cmx sys usr typ lst call pls min tim div sq sqt cnj inv dif sum prd sor prd tst close input ls rs ref up dwn evl sub max mod neg ctx enl con rpt copy but tons sin cos log exp pwr atn arg del cnv id lod sto ent cas dis bel ers rst abcdefg hijklmn opqrstu vwxyz b stoughton page rfc rand ucsb network graphics experiment september ucsb ols connected feed back enter user number id number user name arpa job name rand rfc autosave code load molsf file loaded ols dis play area i ii iii iv v vi vii rel cmx sys usr typ lst call pls min tim div sq sqt cnj inv dif sum prd sor prd tst close input ls rs ref up dwn evl sub max mod neg ctx enl con rpt copy but tons sin cos log exp pwr atn arg del cnv id lod sto ent cas dis bel ers rst abcdefg hijklmn opqrstu vwxyz b stoughton page rfc rand ucsb network graphics experiment september ols dis play area i ii iii iv v vi vii rel cmx sys usr typ lst call pls min tim div sq sqt cnj inv dif sum prd sor prd tst close input ls rs ref up dwn evl sub max mod neg ctx enl con rpt copy but tons sin cos log exp pwr atn arg del cnv id lod sto ent cas dis bel ers rst abcdefg hijklmn opqrstu vwxyz b this rfc was put into machine readable form for entry into the online rfc archives by mark davidson stoughton page
