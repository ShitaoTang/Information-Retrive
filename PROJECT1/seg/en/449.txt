 network working group alex mckenzie rfc bbn nic july there are two significant developments in the operation of the network which should be of interest to all sites new imp system is released on tuesday july the new imp software described in previous rfc s was apparently successfully released we ran from am on that day until wednesday afternoon with very few network problems attributable to the new system we are quite pleased with this performance and expect to leave the new system up permanently we are of course aware that in any system of this size bugs may crop up at any time and we solicit the help of the network community in finding them we also believe that the new system may have a different feel to users both terminal users and hosts we urge everyone to have a bit of patience while getting used to any change in the feel of the network on the other hand please report any suspected network malfunction to the ncc as soon as possible evidence of bugs guesses as to what went wrong etc are always useful in hunting bugs but don t let the lack of positive proof delay the reporting of suspected system malfunction the ncc telephone number is feel free to call collect the one known shortcoming of the new software is the exacerbation of a long standing tip software problem the tip now often appears to neglect sending an allocate control message for some active connection with the effect that the server to user path becomes blocked we are giving the solution of this problem the highest priority our current data seems to indicate that this problem is most likely to occur when there are several users and when the server host is a tenex system if you know of other situations where this problem has occurred please let us know now that the new system is up all sites with model imps will be contacted by telephone and asked to reset the switches on their imps as follows halt inh on w d t on auto rstrt on memory prtct on page site power problems the network has recently been experiencing serious difficulties related to the annual problem of more demand for electricity than is available during the summer months for example during the month of june between and of the imp down time was due to site power failure during the weekend of july two sites were down all weekend due to air conditioning failure which was apparently related to power failures or brownouts this left several sites connected to the rest of the net through only one path which according to murphy s law eventually failed leaving nine sites partitioned from the remainder on july an underground power transformer supplying power to the entire computer room at site failed putting imp out of action for several hours anddit could easily have been several weeks obviously in these cases there is little that either the ncc or the site can do to restore service we expect these situations to continue or even get worse as the summer continues please try to restrain your annoyance when these situations arise we don t like them either this rfc was put into machine readable form for entry into the online rfc archives by bbn corp under the direction of alex mckenzie page
