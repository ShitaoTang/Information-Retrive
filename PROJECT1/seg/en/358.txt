 network working group richard w watson request for comments sri arc nic october categories related obsoletes more on standard host names the network information center is a logical place to handle this problem of standard host names and so the ball now rests here this is clearly a delicate subject with people having strong feelings and attachments to names no past proposal including rfc nic has yet achieved any acceptance this identification seems a natural thing and should be taken into account in setting up a naming scheme therefore the following proposal is offered which i hope may be satisfactory to everyone any naming scheme must recognize the expanding character of the network with the potential eventually of several hundred sites recognize the need for abbreviations to simplify typing recognize the use of names on hardcopy and online documentation recognize people s strong identification with historical names associated with their project to meet these needs we propose adoption of a hybrid scheme related to those in the other past proposals each host will have a formal name of the form and an optional nickname of the form page rww oct more on standard names we have heard no arguments to support severe restrictions on name length and therefore human considerations should probably prevail but would suggest the following guidelines will be at most characters formed as per rfc nic examples of institutions being ames case bbn ucla sri mit harv mitr etc we must recognize that in the future there may be multiple imps and tips and combinations at a given institution so that there is not a one to one correspondence between and imps or tips also affiliated with the network there will be groups and individuals without an imp or a tip or with just a terminal to a tip whose organizations need unique names will not have any restriction on length but should if possible be short in picking an order of priority for choosing this mnemonic might be suborganization within the project mnemonic machine designation the suggestion in rfc nic to include the designation tip or test should probably be followed as conveying useful information examples might be arc nmc ncctip tenexa tenexb multics illiac sail dmcg imp tx etc the should be unique within the network community short and preferably should be the same as to make life easy for people having to learn them i would strongly recommend that telnets recognize both the formal name and the nickname page rww oct more on standard names now the sticky question who chooses the names the only satisfactory answer is to allow the hosts through their liaison to choose their own names possibly subject to some discussion if duplicate or extra long names are picked hosts or stations at a given institution should use the same let s settle this issue as soon as possible say by november each liaison please send me your names by then if there are any implementation hardship cases other than tips caused by the above scheme please let me know as soon as possible this rfc was put into machine readable form for entry into the online rfc archives by bbn corp under the direction of alex mckenzie page
