 networking group a mckenzie request for comments bbn nic september categories f g rand ctu updates none obsoletes rfc site status due to extensive typographic errors in rfc i have decided to reissue the first of our experimental site status reports in compiling rfc i followed the principle that timeliness was somewhat more important than extremely careful editing this seemed to me to be in keeping with the original rfc philosophy i am sorry for any embarrassment this may have caused to anyone associated with the network and accept full responsibility for the content of rfc i will try to do a better job in the future alex mckenzie site status beginning with this rfc bbn will report on the status of most network hosts approximately once every two weeks the information for these reports will be gained from talking to people at each site and from experimental data these data will be the results of daily attempts to log into each of the hosts which might be accessible to a network user the attempts will have been made from the bbn prototype terminal imp at a random time each weekday several hosts are currently excluded from the daily testing these hosts fall into two categories hosts which are note expected to be functioning on the network as servers available for use from other sites for at least a month included here are network site computer address rand pdp lincoln tx stanford pdp page rfc case pdp carnegie pdp paoli b hosts which are currently intended to be users only included here are the terminal imps presently in the network ames mitre and bbn this category also includes the network control center computer network address which is use solely for gathering statistics from the network finally included among these hosts are the following network site computer address rand ibm harvard pdp illinois pdp the tables on the next two pages condense the information on host status for september through september predictions network site computer status or prediction obtained address from ucla sigma server jon postel ucla ibm remote job service now time sharing in january steve wolf sri nic pdp october john melvin sri ai pdp november len chaiten ucsb ibm server jim white utah pdp soon barry wessler bbn ddp ncc alex mckenzie bbn pdp server dan murphy mit multics h soon mike padlipsky mit dm pdp server bob bressler rand ibm user only eric harslem rand pdp january eric harslem sdc ibm october bob long harvard pdp soon bob sundberg harvard pdp user only bob sundberg lincoln ibm soon joel winnet lincoln tx uncertain tom barkalow stanford pdp november andy moorer illinois pdp user only john cravits case pdp december charles rose carnegie pdp january hal vanzoeren paoli b uncertain john cravits page rfc ames tip installed mitre tip installed bbn tip prototype network site computer date and time p m address ucla sigma o o o d d d ucla ibm o o o o o d sri nic pdp d d d d d d sri ai pdp d d d d d d ucsb ibm o o o o o o utah pdp d d d d d d bbn pdp o o t o o mit multics h r r r d o d mit dm pdp t t t o o t sdc ibm d d d d t d harvard pdp t d t t t t lincoln ibm d d t d network site computer date and time p m address ucla sigma o d t o ucla ibm o o o o sri nic pdp d o d d sri ai pdp d d d d ucsb ibm o o o o utah pdp d d d d bbn pdp o o o o mit multics h o t t r mit dm pdp o o d d sdc ibm d d d d harvard pdp d t d d lincoln ibm d d d page rfc where d dead destination host either dead orinaccessible due to network partitioning or local imp failure from the bbn terminal imp r refused destination host returned a cls to the initial rfc t timed out destination host did not respond in any way to the initial rfc although not dead open destination host opened a connection but then either immediately close it or did not respond any further o open destination host opened a connection and was accessible to users endnotes the bbn terminal imp network address is a prototype and as such is frequently not connected to the network but being used to refine and debug the terminal imp programs the ucla ibm is at the moment only able to handle remote job service bbn is not equipped to test this but is assuming that receipt of their canned message indicates that rjs is also functioning this rfc was put into machine readable form for entry into the online rfc archives by roy zimmer page
