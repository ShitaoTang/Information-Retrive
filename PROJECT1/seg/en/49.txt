 network working group e faeh request for comments computer systems laboratory ucsb nic june data reconfiguration service at ucsb this purpose of this rfc is to announce the availability of the data reconfiguration service drs at ucsb and to describe the use of the drs time sharing system the drs is an experiment in a flexible means for reformatting network data streams the drs provides a means for coupling processes with different input output interfaces and carrying out user specified transformations on the data passing between them samples of representative uses of the drs include field insertion field deletion variable length string processing string length computation field transposition character packing and unpacking and character set translations to use the drs a user first defines a form or a description of the reformatting to be performed on data passing between two sockets a form is associated with each unidirectional message path drs may then be directed to establish network connections with the two processes involved and to monitor the dialogue between them drs receives an input stream from one process reformats the input according to the rules specified by the form and emits the reformatted data as an output stream to the second process the two processes communicate as if they were directly connected to each other three major components comprise the drs a compiler which reduces drs source programs forms to a simpler machine independent instruction sequence object program an interpreter which executes the object program created by the compiler and an executive program the drs time sharing system which interfaces the network user to the drs detailed descriptions of the drs source language and compiler are available in the following documents the data reconfiguration service an experiment in adaptable process process communications the rand corp r arpa november data reconfiguration service compiler communications among heterogeneous computer centers using remote resource sharing the rand corp r arpa april the drs time sharing system drs tss and its server telnet are currently available and addressable through socket decimal drs tss interfaces the user to the drs in addition to a subset of faeh page rfc data reconfiguration service at ucsb june tenex like executive commands commands are available for creating and storing forms by name and for invoking the drs compiler or interpreter since both the compiler and the interpreter run asynchronously to the drs tss the user is notified when execution of his requests for compilations or interpreting are initiated and terminated in addition a diagnostic message is supplied by the interpreter whenever it terminates execution of a form when a user connects to drs tss he is allocated an internal tty number by which his terminal is identified when the user issues a command to invoke the compiler or interpreter his tty number and a user specified job name are used to uniquely identify the request the jobname is thereafter used to refer to the request a network host is specified by host name or by host number preceded by a socket number is specified as an integer optionally preceded by a decimal to indicate the radix used decimal is the default radix and positive the default sign a negative socket number is maintained in two s complement form the following control characters are recognized by drs control a soh or rubout del delete the last character control v syn deletes the last word control w etb deletes the last phrase and control x can deletes the entire line control d eot displays the current word control e enq displays the current phrase and control f ack displays the entire line control y em displays the name of the current phrase command accept is carriage return line feed or period a space will force recognition of the current word and will list the input s currently possible the following sections describe the drs tss command syntax denotes command accept and brackets denote optional information all literal information is enclosed in quotes choose one alternative form items in parenthesized lists separated by drs tss command syntax

representing a drs terminal identification number user id is a character string whose maximum length is and whose first character is alphabetic command descriptions attach connects the user s console to the drs tts terminal with identification number terminal must have been previously detached and must not have been deleted currently detached terminals are deleted after hour break causes links to the terminals specified in to be broken if is not specified all established links are broken see link monitor and select for a description of how links are established compile formid causes form to be compiled verification that the source for form exists and that object code does not already exist is made before invoking the drs compiler which executes asynchronously to the user s terminal the drs compiler generates a diagnostic file for the form and if no errors are encountered object files is used to identify the request and may not be used to identify any other job so long as the current request is outstanding faeh page rfc data reconfiguration service at ucsb june because of main storage requirements only one compilation is allowed in execution at any time subsequent requests are queued for later execution unless the request queue is full in which case the request is refused the user is notified when his compilation is initiated and when it terminates convert to allows the user to convert octal decimal or hexadecimal integers from one radix to another specifies the desired radix of the result and may be octal decimal or hexadecimal define allows the user to define a new source form or append to an existing source form the new line indicator replaces the normal to indicate that input will be used to define the source form control c etx signals the end of form definition and elicits the normal new line indicator unfortunately the current facilities for editing forms are extremely limited only the line currently being entered may be edited once a line has been terminated with cr lf and the new line indicator has appeared the line may not be edited the following control characters may be used to edit a form while it is being defined control a soh or rubout del delete the last character control x can deletes the entire line and control f ack displays the entire line if modifications need to be made to lines other than the current line the entire form must be deleted and reentered delete deletes the specified component file s of form specifies the component file to be deleted either source diagnostic or object code if is not specified all components of the form are deleted detach breaks the telnet connection between drs and the user but does not delete the user s drs terminal for some fixed period of time currently hour any jobs the terminal has active are unaffected when the terminal is detached the user may subsequently reconnect to his drs terminal by using the attach command faeh page rfc data reconfiguration service at ucsb june directory lists which component s of form exist a complete form consists of source diagnostics and object code files disconnect breaks the telnet connection between drs and the user and deletes the user s drs terminal any jobs the terminal has active are purged fullduplex directs drs to echo user input nullifies a previous line at a time command halfduplex directs drs not to echo user input nullifies a previous line at a time command help lists the drs control characters and their meanings line at a time tells drs that the user is operating in line at a time mode and nullifies a previous fullduplex or halfduplex command drs will not send any output to the user while he is inputting commands link enable disable the link command may be used to enable or disable links to other terminals or to establish links between terminals link enable directs drs to allow subsequent request by other terminals to establish links with the user s terminal link disable directs drs to refuse subsequent request by other terminals to establish links with the user s terminal link requests drs to establish bidirectional links between the user s terminal and the terminals specified in if is omitted drs attempts to link the user s terminal to all other active terminals while the user s terminal is faeh page rfc data reconfiguration service at ucsb june linked to another terminal all output to the user s terminal will also be routed to the linked terminal and all output to the linked terminal will also be routed to the user s terminal unidirectional links may be established via the monitor and select commands list lists the contents of the file of form may be source diagnostic or object code and defaults to source login logs the user in enables job oriented commands and specifies the account to which the use of drs is to be billed currently billing for drs is not implemented and and may be arbitrarily chosen by the user when billing for drs is implemented user id s and account numbers will be assigned and checked for validity at login the only currently acceptable is arpa logout logs the user out and disables job oriented commands and billing of subsequent activity to the previously specified accounting parameters as with disconnect any jobs the terminal has active are purged monitor requests drs to establish unidirectional links between the user s terminal and the terminals specified in if is omitted drs attempts to link the user s terminal to all other active terminals while the user s terminal is monitoring another terminal all output to that terminal will also be routed to the user s terminal quit requests drs to purge the job request for compilation or interpreting identified by if is omitted all active jobs are purged radix allows the user to specify the radix to be used for subsequent integer display may be octal decimal or hexadecimal the default display radix is decimal faeh page rfc data reconfiguration service at ucsb june rename to allows the user to rename a form the names of all components of the form specified by the first are changed to correspond to the second if the form specified by the second already exists no change of name occurs and the user is notified response all handhold prompt normal unusual errors none allows the user to specify the level of messages the system should provide the default response level is all run simplex duplex causes drs to establish the requested network connections and direct the drs interpreter to apply the specified form s to data passing over the connections the user first specifies the job name by which his request will be identified and second whether simplex or duplex network connections are to be established simplex implies that a single unidirectional message path is to be employed and requires one set of duplex implies that two message paths will be employed are requires two sets of run parameters specify the data necessary to establish a network connection time limits for the drs interpreter and the form which is to be applied to the network data stream sicp uicp rfc byte size connect time run time three methods are available for establishing network connections sicp uicp and rfc sicp server initial connection protocol and uicp causes drs to simulate a server process addressable through socket at ucsb and wait for a user process to connect to it uicp directs drs to simulate a user process and connect to the server addressable through host socket rfc directs drs to connect directly to the two sockets specified in the case of rfc one of the two sockets specified must be a send socket and the other must be a receive socket defaults to the host from which the user logged into the drs tss faeh page rfc data reconfiguration service at ucsb june the remaining fields in are defined as follows byte size specifies the byte size to be used and defaults to connect time specifies the amount of time in seconds that drs should wait for the connection to be established the default value is seconds run time specifies the maximum amount of time in seconds that drs interpreter will be allowed to execute the default value for run time is five minutes specifies the form which is to be applied to the network data stream for each instance of one socket pair is allocated and one form is specified in the case of simplex runs the network data flows between these two sockets with the form being applied to the data in the case of duplex runs the connections are somewhat more complex for duplex runs two sets of are specified causing two socket pairs to be allocated and two forms to be specified call these send socket receive socket and form established via the first set of and send socket receive socket and form established via the second set of parameters when interpreting begins data will flow from send socket through form to receive socket and from send socket through form to receive socket note that without this socket switching processes would be connected to themselves when sicp or uicp is specified the user is notified when his requests for connections are initiated and when the interpreter begins applying a form to a connection when execution of a form terminates the user is supplied with a diagnostic message provided by the interpreter as well as the actual run time of the interpreter select requests drs to establish unidirectional links between the user s terminal and the terminals specified in if is omitted drs attempts to link the user s terminal to all other active faeh page rfc data reconfiguration service at ucsb june terminals while the user s terminal has another terminal selected all output to the user s terminal will also be routed to the selected terminal allows the user to enter any
