 network working group bob bressler bbn request for comments dec nic but my ncp costs a day now that networking is becoming commonplace people are beginning to measure the cost of their network software and network use a not insignificant portion of this use turns out to be random prodding and poking of one system by another an example of this is the survey mechanism that many sites are constructing to see who s up several systems have noted that this one mechanism alone accounts for a log of their overhead and is not chargeable to any given user in response to this particular problem mit dmcg and ucla nmc who have both been doing surveys for some time have agreed upon a standard format for host survey data and will make it available to the network community they will be joined by a third site and will provide a standard socket to obtain this information the data will be a concise character stream so as to be both human and machine readable the exact format of the data and the socket number will be forthcoming the intent of all this is for all other sites to stop surveying on their own and get this data from one of the participating official surveyors either prompted by a user s request or on a periodic basis whatever they wish this should itself help considerably to eliminate a lot of the network noise factor but in addition we should all try to be more aware of the cost of this type of traffic and try to avoid repeated interactions with a given host without some expressed consent be it an account number of some specific experiment bb ph
