 network working group bob thomas request for comments bbn tenex nic march announcement of a tentative workshop on multi site executive programs an executive program is one which accepts and interprets commands from a user calling upon other programs to provide the resources required to satisfy each command there is currently interest in making resources on the arpanet available to the user via a standard conversational facility which one might call an arpanet executive with such a facility a user at a host site or a tip could conveniently access a wide range of resources at other sites without mastering the idiosyncrasies of each host operating system which is contributing resources for example the arpanet executive could make it possible to locate by name a user logged in anywhere on the network and to establish a teletype link to that user in order to engage in an on line dialogue it could also provide status information on the subnet and on all hosts on line arpanet news service on line collections of trouble reports etc the range of possible services is practically unlimited once a basic structure is devised for calling upon these services major areas of interest here are how can the interfaces to resources of interest be standardized so as to be accessible by server processes how can communications with such server processes be standardized an arpanet executive protocol to what extent can the conversational user interface be standardized in the user processes an arpanet executive language how can access authentication and accounting procedures be modified to permit a user to login only once yet use resources at many host sites if you are interested in discussing these and related issues forward your name to bob thomas bthomas bbn tenex bolt beranek and newman inc moulton street cambridge massachusetts extension if there is sufficient response a workshop tentatively planned for april will be hosted by the bbn tenex and bbn tip groups the workshop will permit participants to present relevant work and to discuss the issues raised above thomas page rfc workshop on multi site executive programs march in the meantime an example of an executive program which interprets a limited set of commands in a multi site context is available for experimental use by tip and tenex users the n command of the tip and the rsexec resource sharing executive subsystem on tenex provide command interpretation in the context of tenex and its sites users whose access to the network is neither via a tip or a tenex may use the rsexec by directing their user telnet to icp to socket octal at bbn tenex this rfc was put into machine readable form for entry into the online rfc archives by alex mckenzie with support from gte formerly bbn corp thomas page
