 network working group bob bressler request for comments mit dmcg nic july in response to rfcs and echo and discard mit dmcg host now has deamon processes that will respond to rfcs on sockets and a few administrative type decisions were made to which i would like to solicit comments first if our machine is too full to support another deamon process the pro offered connection will be refused that is a cls will be sent in response to the rfc on socket or second if no activity takes place for two consecutive minutes no characters received on input or output blocked waiting for allocation the connection will be aborted does anyone see the need or desirability for the third service in this set a random character generator many systems provide programs like ttytst available over the standard login connection but there would be no difficulty in creating a server connection like echo offering just this limited service i m sure that it would be useful for new ncps as well as statistics gathering this rfc was put into machine readable form for entry into the online rfc archives by bbn corp under the direction of alex mckenzie page
