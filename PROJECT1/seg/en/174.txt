 network working group e harslem rand request for comments j heafner rand april response to rfc may nwg meeting phase one software status of our software is currently being changed to reflect the new ncp protocol delineated in rfc these changes will be completed before the end of may we are implementing a logger that after an automatic icp dialog can be driven from a local console any desirable messages can be sent or received in ebcdic ascii or as binary streams the purpose of the logger is to allow sites to checkout remote log in procedures since no production oriented services will be offered on the the logger is for experimental purposes only it will be completed before the end of may we have not planned a telnet we will however implement both server and user telnets once a specification is generally accepted implementation time will be on the order of two weeks transition from to pdp we plan to move from our to a pdp rand will offer network services on the pdp the hardware and software status of the pdp will be reported later the network connection will remain for some time due to its production use by another arpa sponsored project at rand maintenance of the network software will be provided for the lifetime of the connection but no new programs will be developed on the after september page network related activities the ucsb rand network activities were recently reported in rfc and earlier in rfc the climate dynamics project cdp at rand will continue to use this facility more heavily in the future in conjunction with the above facility the rand network team has planned and implemented a front end graphics program to allow the reduced data from ucsb to be displayed and interacted with locally as graphs contours plots and lists this will be used in about three months after an intermediate program being written by the cdp personnel is completed phase two experimental data reconfiguration service form machine a working session was held recently at rand on the data reconfiguration service drs the results of which have been drafted and are being edited by the participants these data will be published soon as an rfc eric harslem will be prepared to make an oral report at the nwg meeting on the drs protocol manager we plan to submit a positional paper on a proposed protocol manager which will allow flexibility in both experimental and production use of connection protocols this will be presented as a request for comments on a software package that rand intends to implement for its use on the pdp for example it should obviate a fixed logger on our forthcoming pdp page phase three comments on goals and organization of the nwg we have been proponents of the collective nwg as a forum to raise issues and as a general information transfer mechanism of what sites are doing and thinking more recently small working groups and committees have been formed to generate particular specifications such as telnet the new ncp protocol etc we favor continuance of these methods as long as any site with a willingness an interest and contribution is not excluded from any group or committee we feel that these groups will limit themselves to a small functional size a priori because they are directed toward special interests the long lead time between the formation of such a group and their final output and subsequent implementation of the plan has been accepted by the nwg technical chairman and is rather disconcerting the ncp glitch cleaning committee is an example of expedient work utah for example has already implemented the new ncp protocol other groups including the drs have not been as responsive perhaps the technical problems addressed by other groups are more complex and the needs for their solutions are not as immediate as the ncp glitches we offer no nice solution except that perhaps some guidelines should be established concerning timely publication of reports regarding long range goals of the nwg we do not think that the nwg is the right body to establish the long range goals by long range goals of the nwg we are really concerned in part with long range goals of the network we feel that the principal investigators are in a position to have a better perspective of long range network goals than the nwg members as a suggestion one way of converting their views into nwg tasks is to have the nwg technical chairman host a one day opinion session of the principal investigators then report these views to the nwg for the generation of their implied tasks this rfc was put into machine readable form for entry into the online rfc archives by jim thompson page
