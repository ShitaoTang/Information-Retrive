 network working group a mckenzie rfc bbn net nic may restricted use of imp ddt at the recent workshop on automated resource sharing on the arpanet considerable interest was expressed on the topic of network security in particular representatives of several sites felt that uncontrolled use of imp ddt made access control mechanisms quite vulnerable to interception or tampering individuals at the workshop seemed to be in general agreement that use of ddt should be much more controlled than at present in addition as the network continues to take on a more and more operational character and ncc use of ddt which must be coordinated with other ddt usage increases we begin to see other reasons for controlling access to the ddt mechanism currently and for the foreseeable future it is important that the ncc be able to use ddt at any imp at any time it is also sometimes necessary for site personnel to be able to operate a stand alone ddt after an imp crash sometimes the ncc needs to ask site personnel to operate the imp ddt for the ncc if the network is partitioned we have protected all ddt commands that can affect the running imp program by requiring that sense switch be turned on at the site or a software override flag be enabled only the bbn imp teletype the bbn tip teletype and the pdp can enable override the ncc monitors these flags and reports any change in status in line with this approach we will soon modify the imp system so that any access to imp ddt will require the same enabling actions sense switch four turned on or override enabled from bbn now required for core modification this will still allow the ncc the same ability to operate ddt which it now has and will permit site personnel to operate ddt at the request of the ncc as is currently true the ncc will examples are easy to construct but are intentionally omitted from this document ddt is currently used by the ncc operators for core verification for interface debugging for loading tip and vdh code etc there is discussion of using ddt in conjunction with an auto dialer to examine a tip s view of a modem port at the same time that the auto dialer is examining the outside world s view of the port of running automatic core verification of loading satellite imp code etc mckenzie page rfc restricted use of imp ddt may monitor the setting of sense switch four and take appropriate action if unauthorized use is observed we feel that this change will be sufficient to discourage hackers although it is obviously insufficient to protect a node against a determined and malicious attack it should be noted that it is not our current intent to prohibit occasional use of ddt for communication between sites via ddt messages currently there are two ddt commands c and l which set the single character message and multi character message headers respectively we will continue this facility either by always permitting the use of these ddt commands or by implementing some new code outside ddt for this purpose this rfc was put into machine readable form for entry into the online rfc archives by alex mckenzie with support from gte formerly bbn corp mckenzie page
