 network working group alex mckenzie request for comments bbn nic june categories d g updates none obsoletes none file system questionnaire as noted in rfc page a subcommittee of the nwg under the chairmanship of abhay bhushan is currently generating proposals for a data transfer protocol and a file transfer protocol the subcommittee has decided that the file transfer protocol should provide standard methods for requesting the transfer of a file but should not at this time attempt to standardize file naming conventions access control conventions and the like thus a user who is for example trying to store a file on a remote host will be required to use the file naming conventions appropriate to the remote host given the above point of view it becomes imperative for users to have some source of information about host file conventions such information once compiled will also serve as input to possible standardization efforts of the file transfer subcommittee for this reason abhay has asked me to solicit information on file conventions from the host organizations what follows is a description of the kinds of information of interest i am well aware of the fact that many of you are tired of writing system descriptions xerox copies of short sections of your local documentation are fine if the result is complete and comprehensible in the case that your host will never permit network use of your file system a note to that effect would be sufficient information requested file naming conventions we loosely define a pathname to be the data string which must be input to the file system by a user a network user if your system makes a distinction between local and network users in order to identify a file we are interested in syntax semantics and defaults typical components of pathnames are device fields user names version numbers index names punctuation marks page common types of defaults are device is disk version number is largest in system for hierarchical file structures descriptions may be fairly complex but with lots of defaults in such cases an illustration of a normal pathname might be helpful access control mechanisms access control mechanisms range from simply knowledge of a file s pathname to elaborate hierarchies of group project task username membership with passwords and separate controls for reading and writing there are two aspects of the access control mechanism which are of interest a a description of what inputs the user should give the file system both at the time of file creation and at the time of retrieval in order to define the permitted modes of access and to gain access what are the syntax and semantics of these inputs b a description of the ways in which the access control mechanism is designed to help or hinder the sharing of files for example may two users simultaniously update a given file may the creator of the file define a set of authorized users to the file system and how is it possible to define different access controls for various subunits of a given file directories many systems maintain file directories which are designed to be helpful to the user a directory might for example provide a list of all files created by a particular individual along with some information regarding file size file structure access controls etc in general such systems allow the user to input a pathname and retrieve the directory to which that pathname refers aspects of the directory structure of interest are a what are the syntax and semantics of a directory pathname b what use is a directory i e what type of information does the directory contain c what access controls are used for access to the directories for example must a user supply a password in order to retrieve a directory and is this password typically the same as the password he would use to retrieve a file listed in that directory page commands and functions of the file system a general description of what the file system is designed to do would be useful for example the system might simply accept an entire file and store it sequentially on a tape with the only mode of retrieval being to retrieve the entire file on the other hand the system might provide the ability to access any subfield with a unique pathname perhaps there is the ability to restructure a file change the access control delete all the fields associated with a directory etc we realize that this aspect of the file system begins to overlap the area of data management which is the responsibility of another subcommittee therefore use your judgement as to what functions are an intrinsic aspect of the file handling system and which are aspects of data management internal representation and i o modes the remote user of a file system will normally be interested in internal representation of data only insofar as that representation of data is reflected in the i o interface between the file system and the network for example if all of the file system s i o is in bit ascii characters then the user is unlikely to care if they are stored in ascii ebcdic or some other form however if an alternate transmission mode is available it may be useful for example two pdp s both of which store characters and one filler bit per word might find it advantageous to transfer information in this mode rather than converting between internal representation and bit ascii for each character other information on internal representation which would be of interest to the user might include if applicable range of numeric data permitted maximum text string lengths whether the user must indicate record boundaries on input what logical structure information the user may specify for a new file and what he must specify whether the user must specify the file size before beginning input and how he does it undoubtedly there will be aspects of each file system which don t fit neatly into the categories above but which users will find important or essantial in using the system these should be identified and described if possible please address responses to this questionnaire to alex mckenzie bolt beranek and newman inc moulton street cambridge massachusetts page if the questions above are confusing don t hesitate to call me for clarification at ext i will issue another rfc summarizing the responses after i have received a significant number of them this rfc was put into machine readable form for entry into the online rfc archives by stefan hinker page
