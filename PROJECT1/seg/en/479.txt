 network working group m a padlipsky request for comments mit multics nic june feast or famine a response to two recent rfc s about network information in rfc will kantrowitz returns to the theme of his superb rfc there are too many people spending too much time asking for too much information about network hosts in rfc john pickens returns to the theme of his rather querulous rfc it s not easy to learn how to use network hosts on the one hand it would seem that there s a veritable feast of information going around on the other hand it would seem that there s a terrible famine can this apparent contradiction be resolved i think it can be and will attempt to do so after making a few observations about the respective poles in regard to the issues kantrowitz raises matters are perhaps even worse for the big servers than for the experimental ones we have something like cubic feet of system listings for multics plus untold user supplied programs which might be of interest plus several thousand employees if our site is construed to mean m i t as a whole surely they didn t want all that even before the request was withdrawn but what of the issues pickens raises surely prospective users ought to have some means of learning about the resources available the point it seems to me is that they do but they aren t using them as network technical liaison for multics i ve never heard from any of the u c s b investigators i don t even recall their having requested a multics programmers manual despite the fact that our resource notebook section offers one to any network site on request i do recall seeing instance after instance of botched login attempts from them in our error logs though i called their liaison to alert him to the problem but they weren t in touch with him either i also recall saying time after time after seeing them floundering around it s a pity nobody reads the resource notebook that i think is the key we have a resource notebook it lists technical liaisons it gives information about the hosts thought to be relevant to network users it gives references to other published information why don t we use it sure not all the sections are up to par sure some sorts of information are neither contained nor pointed to but that amounts to a need for seasoning the meal is there and it s neither a glutton s portion nor a starvation diet let s work with what we ve got instead of charging around demanding more padlipsky page rfc feast or famine june or sulking around bemoaning the false fact that the cupboard is bare placing the right amount of reliance on the resource notebook then ought to lead to a solution of the information problem in its current form it would have solved the u c s b people s problems fairly completely for it already tells them to get in touch with me and it already shows them how to log in assuming of course that it wasn t the unstated object of their game to do it all with only on line information the resource notebook could even have solved the rml people s problems for had it been made clear to them that global requests for host information are to be handled through the notebook they d have been in touch with people who could have explained why their requests were inappropriate and on close decisions the resource notebook maintainers would know whom to consult with in regard to appropriateness of results for new categories i believe this is not meant to push the resource notebook as a panacea clearly it needs strengthing in terms of content even more clearly it needs wide dissemination the planned network new users packet will show how to get at it on line at the nic i m told even better perhaps we might want to make it available in microfiche also this is certainly not meant to suggest that the notebook be viewed as supplanting the individual hosts users manuals although it does seem to be the partial repository for documentation to any generic commands we manage to come up with but i also think it s important for the nwg to understand and agree on the proper perspective in which to view the resource notebook and i suggest that that perspective should be as primary source of host information to view it otherwise would it seems to me be wasting both the investment it already represents and the opportunity it can represent this rfc was put into machine readable form for entry into the online rfc archives by alex mckenzie with support from gte formerly bbn corp padlipsky page
